    "question": "What is Spring MVC and what are its three main components?",
    "answer": "Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework that is part of the larger Spring Framework, widely used for building web applications in Java. It provides a structured way to develop web applications by separating the application into three interconnected components: 1) Model - represents the data and business logic, responsible for retrieving, processing, and storing data; 2) View - represents the user interface, responsible for rendering model data to users using technologies like JSP or Thymeleaf; 3) Controller - acts as an intermediary between Model and View, handling user input and returning appropriate views."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the DispatcherServlet and what role does it play in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "The DispatcherServlet is the core component and front controller of the Spring MVC framework. It handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controllers. It intercepts all incoming HTTP requests, uses HandlerMapping to determine which controller should handle the request, delegates routing and manages the overall flow of the application. It's responsible for the entire request handling process from receiving the request to returning the response."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key features of Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Key features of Spring MVC include: 1) DispatcherServlet as the core component for request routing; 2) Annotations like @Controller, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping for simplified configuration; 3) Flexible View Resolution supporting various view technologies; 4) Data Binding and Validation with built-in support for binding request parameters to Java objects; 5) RESTful Web Services support for building APIs; 6) Integration with Spring ecosystem including security, data access, and transaction management."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the common use cases for Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Spring MVC is commonly used for: 1) Building web applications with traditional MVC architecture; 2) Creating RESTful services and APIs; 3) Developing microservices; 4) Building scalable and maintainable web applications. Its modular architecture and extensive features make it a popular choice among Java developers for creating enterprise-level applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of Controllers in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Controllers in Spring MVC are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the model, and returning the appropriate view. They contain the business logic and are annotated with @Controller or @RestController (for RESTful services). Controllers handle the mapping between HTTP requests and business logic, process user input, and determine which view should be rendered or what data should be returned."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Model component in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "The Model in Spring MVC represents the data and business logic of the application. It can be represented by Java objects (POJOs) that hold the data. The model is often populated by the controller and passed to the view for rendering. It's responsible for managing the application's data, business rules, and state, and serves as the data source for the view layer."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the View component and how does it work in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "The View in Spring MVC is responsible for rendering the user interface. Views can be implemented using various technologies such as JSP, Thymeleaf, or FreeMarker. The view takes the model data provided by the controller and generates the final output (HTML, JSON, etc.) to be sent back to the client. Views are typically resolved by a ViewResolver, which maps logical view names to actual view implementations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a ViewResolver in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "ViewResolver is a component responsible for resolving logical view names returned by controllers into actual view implementations. It helps determine which view technology to use and how to render the view. ViewResolvers map the logical view names (strings returned by controller methods) to physical view files, enabling the separation of controller logic from view implementation details."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is HandlerMapping in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "HandlerMapping is a component that maps incoming requests to the appropriate controller methods. It uses various strategies to determine which controller should handle a specific request based on the URL pattern and HTTP method. HandlerMapping examines the request URL, HTTP method, and other request attributes to find the most suitable handler method in the controllers."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of HandlerAdapter in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "HandlerAdapter is responsible for invoking controller methods. It adapts the request and response objects to the method parameters of the controller. The HandlerAdapter acts as a bridge between the DispatcherServlet and the actual controller methods, handling the conversion of HTTP requests into method parameters and ensuring the controller method is called with the correct arguments."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Interceptors in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Interceptors in Spring MVC allow you to perform operations before and after the execution of a controller method. They can be used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, authorization, and performance monitoring. Interceptors provide hooks into the request processing lifecycle, enabling you to add functionality without modifying the controller code directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Exception Handling work in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Spring MVC provides comprehensive exception handling mechanisms. You can use @ExceptionHandler and @ControllerAdvice annotations to define global or specific exception handling logic. Exception handling allows you to catch and process exceptions that occur during request processing, providing custom error responses and maintaining application stability. This helps in centralizing error handling and providing consistent error responses to clients."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Binding and Validation features in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Spring MVC supports data binding and validation of user input. Data binding automatically maps request parameters to Java objects, while validation ensures the data meets specified criteria. You can bind request parameters to Java objects using annotations and validate them using annotations like @Valid or @Validated. This includes support for JSR-303/JSR-380 validation annotations and custom validation logic."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the Spring MVC request lifecycle in detail.",
    "answer": "The Spring MVC request lifecycle involves 10 steps: 1) Client sends HTTP request; 2) DispatcherServlet receives and intercepts the request; 3) HandlerMapping determines the appropriate controller; 4) HandlerAdapter invokes the controller method; 5) Controller processes the request and returns a view name or model; 6) ViewResolver resolves the view name to an actual view; 7) View is rendered using model data and response is generated; 8) Response is sent back to the client; 9) Interceptors may perform additional processing; 10) Exception handling occurs if needed. This lifecycle ensures clean separation of concerns and maintainable web applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during the Client Request phase of the lifecycle?",
    "answer": "The lifecycle begins when a client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server. This is the initial trigger that starts the entire Spring MVC request processing cycle. The request contains all the necessary information including the URL, HTTP method, headers, and any request parameters or body data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the DispatcherServlet handle incoming requests?",
    "answer": "The DispatcherServlet acts as the front controller and intercepts all incoming HTTP requests. It is configured in the web application's deployment descriptor (web.xml) or through Java configuration. When a request arrives, the DispatcherServlet takes control and orchestrates the entire request processing workflow, coordinating with other components like HandlerMapping, HandlerAdapter, and ViewResolver."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the HandlerMapping phase in the request lifecycle?",
    "answer": "During the HandlerMapping phase, the DispatcherServlet uses HandlerMapping to determine which controller should handle the incoming request. It matches the request URL and HTTP method to the appropriate handler method. This mapping can be based on annotations (like @RequestMapping) or XML configuration, and it's responsible for finding the most suitable controller method to process the request."
  },
  {
    "question": "What occurs during the HandlerAdapter phase?",
    "answer": "Once the appropriate controller is identified, the DispatcherServlet uses a HandlerAdapter to invoke the controller method. The HandlerAdapter adapts the request and response objects to the method parameters of the controller. It handles the conversion of HTTP request data into the appropriate Java objects that the controller method expects as parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during Controller Execution?",
    "answer": "During Controller Execution, the controller processes the request by interacting with the service layer, performing business logic, and preparing a model (data) to be returned to the view. The controller typically returns a logical view name or a model object. This is where the actual business processing occurs, including data retrieval, validation, and any necessary computations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Model and View phase work?",
    "answer": "In the Model and View phase, if the controller returns a logical view name, the DispatcherServlet uses a ViewResolver to resolve this name into an actual view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf template). If the controller returns a model object (in RESTful services), the response is prepared accordingly. This phase determines how the data will be presented to the client."
  },
  {
    "question": "What occurs during View Rendering?",
    "answer": "During View Rendering, the resolved view is rendered using the model data provided by the controller. The view takes the model data and generates the final output (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.) that will be sent back to the client. This is where the presentation logic is applied and the final response content is created."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Response phase complete the lifecycle?",
    "answer": "In the Response phase, the rendered view is returned to the DispatcherServlet, which then sends the final response back to the client. This completes the request-response cycle, delivering the processed content to the client that initiated the request. The response includes the appropriate headers, status codes, and content."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role do Interceptors play in the request lifecycle?",
    "answer": "Throughout the request lifecycle, if any interceptors are configured, they can execute pre-processing and post-processing logic. Interceptors can perform actions before the controller method is called, after it completes, and after the entire request is finished. This includes activities like logging, authentication, modifying requests/responses, and performance monitoring."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is Exception Handling integrated into the request lifecycle?",
    "answer": "Exception handling is integrated throughout the request lifecycle. If any exceptions occur during request processing, they can be handled by @ExceptionHandler methods in the controller or by global exception handling defined with @ControllerAdvice. This ensures that errors are caught and processed appropriately, allowing for graceful error responses instead of application crashes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key responsibilities of DispatcherServlet as a front controller?",
    "answer": "As a front controller, DispatcherServlet has several key responsibilities: 1) Acts as the central point that receives all incoming HTTP requests; 2) Uses URL mapping to determine which controller should handle each request; 3) Consults HandlerMapping to find the appropriate handler for incoming requests; 4) Invokes handler methods through HandlerAdapter; 5) Takes returned model and view name and consults ViewResolver; 6) Delegates view rendering to resolved view components; 7) Handles exceptions through configured exception resolvers; 8) Manages the Spring application context lifecycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does DispatcherServlet handle request routing?",
    "answer": "DispatcherServlet handles request routing by using the URL mapping defined in web application configuration (usually in web.xml or through Java configuration) to determine which controller should handle the request. It examines the incoming request's URL, HTTP method, and other attributes, then consults HandlerMapping to find the most appropriate handler method to process the request."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of DispatcherServlet in Handler Execution?",
    "answer": "In Handler Execution, once the appropriate handler is identified, the DispatcherServlet invokes the handler method through HandlerAdapter. The handler method typically processes the request, interacts with the service layer, and prepares a model (data) to be returned to the view. The DispatcherServlet coordinates this entire process and manages the flow between different components."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does DispatcherServlet manage View Resolution?",
    "answer": "After the handler method completes, the DispatcherServlet takes the returned model and view name and consults the ViewResolver to determine which view should be rendered. The ViewResolver maps logical view names to actual view implementations (JSP, Thymeleaf template, etc.). The DispatcherServlet then coordinates the view rendering process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is DispatcherServlet's role in Response Rendering?",
    "answer": "The DispatcherServlet delegates the rendering of the view to the resolved view component, which generates the final output (HTML, JSON, etc.) to be sent back to the client. It manages the entire response generation process and ensures that the properly formatted response is returned to the client that made the original request."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does DispatcherServlet handle exceptions?",
    "answer": "If any exceptions occur during request processing, the DispatcherServlet can handle them through configured exception resolvers. This allows for centralized error handling and provides mechanisms to return appropriate error responses to clients. The DispatcherServlet ensures that exceptions are caught and processed gracefully rather than causing application failures."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is DispatcherServlet's role in Lifecycle Management?",
    "answer": "The DispatcherServlet is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the Spring application context associated with it. It initializes the context, loads beans, and manages their lifecycle, ensuring that all necessary components are available for request processing. This includes setting up the Spring container and managing the dependencies between different components."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do different components integrate during a request in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "During a request in Spring MVC, components integrate through a well-defined workflow: 1) DispatcherServlet receives the request and acts as the orchestrator; 2) HandlerMapping identifies the appropriate controller; 3) Controller processes the request and prepares model data; 4) ViewResolver maps logical view names to actual views; 5) View renders using model data; 6) DispatcherServlet constructs and sends the HTTP response. Each component has a specific role and they work together seamlessly through the DispatcherServlet coordination."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during the Request Handling phase of component integration?",
    "answer": "When a client makes a request (via web browser), the request is received by the web server, which forwards it to the application. The DispatcherServlet acts as the first point of contact, managing the entire request processing workflow and coordinating the interaction between all other components in the Spring MVC architecture."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Handler Mapping work in component integration?",
    "answer": "The DispatcherServlet uses handler mappings to determine which controller should handle the incoming request. This is typically based on the URL pattern and HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.). The handler mapping examines the request characteristics and matches them to the appropriate controller method that should process the request."
  },
  {
    "question": "What occurs during Controller Invocation in the integration process?",
    "answer": "Once the appropriate controller is identified, the DispatcherServlet invokes the controller method that corresponds to the request. The controller processes the request, often interacting with services and repositories to retrieve or manipulate data. The controller then prepares the model data and determines the appropriate view to render."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Model and View preparation work in component integration?",
    "answer": "After processing the request, the controller prepares a model (data) and returns a view name (a logical name of the view to be rendered). The model is usually a data structure (like a Map or custom object) that contains the data needed for the view. This separates the data preparation from the presentation logic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the View Resolution phase in component integration?",
    "answer": "The DispatcherServlet uses a view resolver to map the logical view name returned by the controller to an actual view implementation (like JSP, Thymeleaf template, etc.). The view resolver is configured in the application context and can resolve views based on various strategies such as prefix/suffix patterns or other naming conventions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does View Rendering work in the integration process?",
    "answer": "Once the view is resolved, the DispatcherServlet delegates the rendering of the view to the appropriate view technology (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf). The view is rendered using the model data provided by the controller, generating the final output that will be sent to the client. This creates the actual HTML or other content format."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during Response Generation in component integration?",
    "answer": "The rendered view is then sent back to the DispatcherServlet, which constructs the HTTP response and sends it back to the client. This completes the request-response cycle, and the client receives the rendered HTML (or other content types) as the final response to their original request."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the integration process complete the request-response cycle?",
    "answer": "The integration of controllers and view resolvers during a request involves a series of steps managed by the DispatcherServlet, which coordinates the flow from request handling to response generation. Each component plays a specific role in processing the request and rendering the appropriate response, with the DispatcherServlet acting as the central coordinator throughout the entire process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is WebApplicationContext and what are its key roles?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext is a specialized version of the ApplicationContext interface designed specifically for web applications. Its key roles include: 1) Extension of ApplicationContext with web-specific features; 2) Integration with servlet context for accessing servlet-specific resources; 3) Scope management supporting request, session, and global session scopes; 4) Resource loading from web application context; 5) Event propagation within web applications; 6) Internationalization support; 7) Configuration of web components like filters, servlets, and listeners; 8) Integration with Spring MVC architecture for managing controllers and view resolvers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does WebApplicationContext extend ApplicationContext?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext is a specialized version of the ApplicationContext interface that provides additional features relevant to web environments. While ApplicationContext provides the basic IoC container functionality, WebApplicationContext adds web-specific capabilities such as servlet context integration, web-aware bean scopes, and access to servlet-specific resources and configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does WebApplicationContext integrate with Servlet Context?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext is tightly integrated with the servlet context, allowing it to access servlet-specific resources and configurations. This integration means it can manage beans that are specific to web applications, such as controllers, view resolvers, filters, and other web components. It can access servlet context parameters and attributes, making it aware of the web environment in which it operates."
  },
  {
    "question": "What scope management capabilities does WebApplicationContext provide?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext supports different scopes for beans, including request, session, and global session scopes in addition to the standard singleton and prototype scopes. This is essential for managing the lifecycle of beans in a web application, where the same bean might need to be instantiated differently for different user sessions or requests, allowing for proper state management in web environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does WebApplicationContext handle resource loading?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext provides mechanisms to load resources (like files, images, configuration files, etc.) from the web application's context. This makes it easier to access resources that are packaged with the web application, such as static files, templates, configuration files, and other assets that are part of the web application deployment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What event propagation capabilities does WebApplicationContext offer?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext allows for the propagation of events within the web application context. This means that components can publish and listen for events, facilitating communication between different parts of the application. This event-driven architecture enables loose coupling between components and supports more flexible application designs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does WebApplicationContext support internationalization?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext provides support for internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to serve different languages and locales based on user preferences or settings. It can manage message sources, locale resolvers, and other i18n-related components, making it easier to create applications that support multiple languages and regional settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is WebApplicationContext's role in configuring web components?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext is responsible for configuring web components such as filters, servlets, and listeners. This configuration can be done through XML files or Java-based configuration using annotations. It manages the lifecycle and dependencies of these web-specific components, ensuring they are properly initialized and configured within the web application environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does WebApplicationContext integrate with Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "In Spring MVC applications, WebApplicationContext is used to manage controllers, view resolvers, and other components that are part of the MVC architecture. It provides the IoC container functionality specifically tailored for web applications, managing the lifecycle of MVC components and their dependencies, and ensuring proper integration between the web layer and business logic layers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is WebApplicationContext typically created and used?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext is typically created by the Spring framework when the web application starts up. It can be defined in the web.xml file or through Java configuration using annotations. The context is then used to retrieve beans and manage their lifecycle throughout the web application. It serves as the central registry for all web-related beans and their dependencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What makes WebApplicationContext vital for Spring web applications?",
    "answer": "WebApplicationContext is a vital component in Spring web applications because it provides the necessary infrastructure to manage web-specific beans, resources, and configurations effectively. It bridges the gap between the generic ApplicationContext and the specific needs of web applications, offering features like web-aware bean scopes, servlet integration, and web resource management that are essential for building robust web applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Saga pattern and how is it used for managing distributed transactions in Spring MVC microservices?",
    "answer": "The Saga pattern is a design pattern for managing distributed transactions across multiple microservices by breaking them into a series of local transactions. Each service performs its local transaction and publishes events to trigger the next transaction. There are two main implementations: Choreography (each service listens for events and reacts accordingly) and Orchestration (a central coordinator manages the sequence). In Spring MVC, this can be implemented using Spring Cloud Stream for event handling, where if any step fails, compensating transactions are executed to maintain data consistency without requiring distributed locks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you implement the Choreography-based Saga pattern in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "In Choreography-based Saga, each service publishes and listens to events without a central coordinator. Implementation involves: 1) Define domain events for each transaction step; 2) Use Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Events to publish events after local transactions; 3) Implement event listeners in each service using @EventListener or @StreamListener; 4) Define compensating actions for rollback scenarios; 5) Use message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ for reliable event delivery. Each service manages its own state and triggers the next step by publishing events, creating a decentralized transaction flow."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Orchestration-based Saga pattern and how does it differ from Choreography?",
    "answer": "Orchestration-based Saga uses a central coordinator (Saga Orchestrator) that manages the entire transaction workflow. The orchestrator knows the sequence of steps and coordinates between services by sending commands and handling responses. Key differences from Choreography: 1) Centralized control vs distributed; 2) Explicit workflow definition vs implicit event chains; 3) Easier to track and debug vs more resilient to failures; 4) Single point of failure vs distributed complexity. In Spring MVC, this can be implemented using Spring State Machine or custom orchestrator services that maintain transaction state and coordinate service calls."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle compensating transactions in a Saga pattern?",
    "answer": "Compensating transactions are used to undo the effects of completed transactions when a saga fails. Implementation approaches include: 1) Define compensating actions for each transaction step that can reverse its effects; 2) Maintain transaction logs to track completed steps; 3) Execute compensations in reverse order when failures occur; 4) Use idempotent operations to ensure compensations can be safely retried; 5) Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running compensations. In Spring MVC, compensating actions can be implemented as separate service methods annotated with @Compensate or similar custom annotations, with event-driven execution using messaging systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the challenges of implementing Saga patterns in Spring MVC microservices?",
    "answer": "Key challenges include: 1) Complexity in designing and maintaining saga workflows across multiple services; 2) Debugging distributed transactions across service boundaries; 3) Handling partial failures and ensuring compensating transactions execute correctly; 4) Managing eventual consistency and dealing with temporary inconsistent states; 5) Ensuring idempotency of both forward and compensating transactions; 6) Dealing with network failures and message delivery guarantees; 7) Performance overhead of maintaining transaction state and event processing; 8) Testing distributed scenarios and failure cases; 9) Monitoring and observability across the entire saga execution."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you implement WebSocket support in Spring MVC for real-time communication?",
    "answer": "WebSocket support in Spring MVC is implemented through Spring WebSocket framework: 1) Add spring-websocket dependency; 2) Enable WebSocket with @EnableWebSocket; 3) Implement WebSocketHandler or extend TextWebSocketHandler for handling connections; 4) Configure WebSocket endpoints using WebSocketConfigurer; 5) Use @MessageMapping for handling WebSocket messages; 6) Implement STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) for higher-level messaging; 7) Configure message brokers for pub/sub scenarios; 8) Handle connection lifecycle events (onOpen, onMessage, onClose, onError). This enables bidirectional, full-duplex communication between client and server for real-time features."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is STOMP and how is it used with WebSockets in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) is a protocol that provides a higher-level messaging abstraction over WebSocket. In Spring MVC: 1) It provides a frame-based protocol for messaging with destinations, headers, and body; 2) Enables pub/sub messaging patterns with topic-based routing; 3) Supports message acknowledgments and transactions; 4) Integrates with Spring's message handling annotations like @MessageMapping and @SendTo; 5) Allows client-side libraries to work with different message brokers; 6) Provides built-in support for user sessions and security; 7) Enables broadcasting messages to multiple clients subscribed to topics. STOMP simplifies WebSocket programming by providing messaging semantics similar to JMS."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure WebSocket endpoints and message brokers in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "WebSocket configuration involves implementing WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer: 1) Use @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker annotation; 2) Override registerStompEndpoints() to define client connection endpoints with SockJS fallback; 3) Override configureMessageBroker() to configure message routing - enableSimpleBroker() for in-memory broker or enableStompBrokerRelay() for external brokers like RabbitMQ; 4) Set application destination prefixes for client-to-server messages; 5) Configure client inbound/outbound channels for message processing; 6) Set up security configurations for WebSocket endpoints; 7) Configure cross-origin requests if needed. This provides the foundation for real-time messaging in Spring MVC applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "What security considerations apply to WebSocket connections in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "WebSocket security considerations include: 1) Authentication - verify user identity during handshake using HTTP session or custom authentication; 2) Authorization - control access to specific channels or destinations; 3) CSRF protection - implement CSRF tokens for WebSocket handshake; 4) Same-origin policy - validate origin headers to prevent cross-site WebSocket hijacking; 5) Message validation - sanitize and validate all incoming messages; 6) Session management - properly handle user sessions and cleanup on disconnect; 7) Rate limiting - prevent abuse by limiting message frequency; 8) Encryption - use WSS (WebSocket Secure) for encrypted communication; 9) Input filtering - validate message content to prevent injection attacks. Spring Security provides WebSocket-specific security configurations."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle WebSocket session management and user tracking in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "WebSocket session management involves: 1) Use WebSocketSession to track individual connections; 2) Implement SessionConnectedEvent and SessionDisconnectEvent listeners to track user connections; 3) Maintain user-to-session mappings using SimpUserRegistry; 4) Use @SendToUser to send messages to specific users; 5) Implement custom HandshakeInterceptor to associate HTTP sessions with WebSocket sessions; 6) Use Principal-based messaging for authenticated users; 7) Handle session cleanup on disconnect to prevent memory leaks; 8) Implement heartbeat mechanisms to detect stale connections; 9) Use WebSocketSessionStore for clustered environments. This enables user-specific messaging and proper resource management."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the performance optimization techniques for Spring MVC applications?",
    "answer": "Key performance optimization techniques include: 1) Caching - implement application-level, HTTP, and database caching; 2) Database optimization - use connection pooling, query optimization, and proper indexing; 3) Asynchronous processing - use @Async for non-blocking operations; 4) Resource management - optimize static resource handling and compression; 5) JVM tuning - configure garbage collection and memory settings; 6) Load balancing - distribute traffic across multiple instances; 7) CDN usage - serve static content from edge locations; 8) Monitoring and profiling - identify bottlenecks using APM tools; 9) Code optimization - minimize object creation and improve algorithm efficiency; 10) Lazy loading - defer expensive operations until needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you implement method-level caching in Spring MVC using annotations?",
    "answer": "Method-level caching is implemented using Spring's caching annotations: 1) Enable caching with @EnableCaching; 2) Configure cache manager bean (ConcurrentMapCacheManager, RedisCacheManager, etc.); 3) Use @Cacheable to cache method results based on parameters; 4) Use @CachePut to update cache entries; 5) Use @CacheEvict to remove entries from cache; 6) Use @Caching for complex caching scenarios with multiple operations; 7) Define custom key generators using SpEL expressions; 8) Implement conditional caching with condition and unless attributes; 9) Configure cache names and expiration policies; 10) Use @CacheConfig at class level for common cache settings. This provides declarative caching without modifying business logic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict annotations?",
    "answer": "@Cacheable checks if a result exists in cache before executing the method - if cached, returns cached value; if not, executes method and stores result. @CachePut always executes the method and updates the cache with the result, useful for cache updates after data modifications. @CacheEvict removes entries from the cache, with options to evict specific entries or clear entire cache regions. Key differences: @Cacheable can skip method execution, @CachePut always executes and updates, @CacheEvict focuses on cache invalidation. These annotations can be combined using @Caching for complex scenarios requiring multiple cache operations on a single method."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you configure Redis as a cache provider in Spring MVC?",
    "answer": "Redis configuration for caching involves: 1) Add spring-boot-starter-data-redis dependency; 2) Configure Redis connection properties (host, port, password); 3) Create RedisCacheManager bean with cache configurations; 4) Set up RedisTemplate with appropriate serializers (JSON, String, etc.); 5) Configure cache names, TTL, and eviction policies; 6) Use RedisConnectionFactory for connection pooling; 7) Implement custom cache configurations for different cache regions; 8) Set up Redis cluster or sentinel configuration for high availability; 9) Configure serialization strategies for cache keys and values; 10) Enable cache statistics and monitoring. This provides distributed caching across multiple application instances."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are cache eviction policies and how are they configured in Spring MVC?",
