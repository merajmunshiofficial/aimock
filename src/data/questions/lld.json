    "question": "What is Low-Level Design (LLD) and how does it differ from High-Level Design?",
    "answer": "Low-level design (LLD) is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that focuses on the detailed design of individual components or modules of a system. It typically follows high-level design (HLD) and provides a more granular view of how the system will be implemented. While HLD focuses on the overall system architecture and major components, LLD delves into the specific implementation details including class diagrams, data structures, algorithms, interfaces, and database schemas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key components of Low-Level Design?",
    "answer": "The key components of LLD include: 1) Class Diagrams - defining classes, attributes, methods, and relationships; 2) Sequence Diagrams - illustrating object interactions in use cases; 3) Data Structures - defining how data is stored and manipulated; 4) Algorithms - detailing processing logic with complexity analysis; 5) Interface Design - specifying module communication; 6) Error Handling - outlining exception management; 7) Database Design - providing schema and relationship details; 8) Configuration and Environment - describing application settings; 9) Security Considerations - identifying risks and mitigation strategies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java for LLD?",
    "answer": "The fundamental OOP concepts in Java for LLD include: 1) Classes and Objects - blueprints and instances; 2) Encapsulation - bundling data and methods with access modifiers; 3) Inheritance - allowing code reusability through class hierarchies; 4) Polymorphism - enabling different behaviors through method overriding and overloading; 5) Interfaces and Abstract Classes - defining contracts and partial implementations; 6) Composition - building classes from existing components; 7) Design Patterns - reusable solutions to common problems; 8) Exception Handling - managing runtime errors gracefully."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and how is it implemented?",
    "answer": "The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. For example, instead of having a User class that handles both user data and email sending, SRP suggests separating these into a User class for data, UserRepository for database operations, and EmailService for email functionality. This makes the code more maintainable, testable, and follows the principle of separation of concerns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the Open/Closed Principle with a Java example.",
    "answer": "The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. For example, instead of modifying an AreaCalculator class every time you add a new shape, create a Shape interface with an area() method. Then implement different shapes (Rectangle, Circle) that implement this interface. The AreaCalculator can work with any Shape without modification, and new shapes can be added by simply implementing the interface."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Liskov Substitution Principle and why is it important?",
    "answer": "The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. For example, if you have a Bird class with a fly() method, having an Ostrich subclass that throws an exception in fly() violates LSP. Instead, create separate interfaces like Bird for general bird behavior and FlyingBird for birds that can fly. This ensures that substituting objects doesn't break the application's functionality."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Interface Segregation Principle improve code design?",
    "answer": "The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Instead of creating large, monolithic interfaces, create smaller, specific interfaces. For example, instead of a single Worker interface with both work() and eat() methods, create separate Workable and Eatable interfaces. This allows HumanWorker to implement both, while RobotWorker only implements Workable, avoiding the need to implement unnecessary eat() functionality."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Dependency Inversion Principle and how does it promote loose coupling?",
    "answer": "The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. For example, instead of a Switch class directly depending on a LightBulb class, both should depend on a Switchable interface. This allows the Switch to work with any device that implements Switchable, making the system more flexible and easier to test and maintain."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the DRY principle apply to low-level design in Java?",
    "answer": "The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle emphasizes reducing code duplication. In Java LLD, this is achieved through: 1) Using methods to encapsulate repeated logic; 2) Inheritance and interfaces to abstract common behavior; 3) Composition to reuse existing classes; 4) Design patterns like Singleton and Factory; 5) Utility classes with static methods for common operations; 6) Regular refactoring to identify and eliminate duplication. This leads to more maintainable, testable, and less error-prone code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the YAGNI principle and how does it guide design decisions?",
    "answer": "YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) emphasizes not adding functionality until it is necessary. In low-level design, this means: 1) Focusing on current requirements only; 2) Avoiding premature optimization; 3) Keeping interfaces simple with only necessary methods; 4) Refactoring when new functionality is actually needed; 5) Using feature flags for uncertain features; 6) Writing tests for current functionality; 7) Following iterative development. This prevents over-engineering and keeps the codebase clean and maintainable."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the KISS principle influence Java design decisions?",
    "answer": "The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle promotes simplicity in design. In Java, this involves: 1) Avoiding over-engineering by keeping classes focused; 2) Using clear, descriptive naming conventions; 3) Writing small, focused methods; 4) Minimizing complexity with shallow nesting and simple data structures; 5) Implementing straightforward error handling; 6) Writing self-documenting code; 7) Creating simple, testable components. This results in code that is easier to understand, maintain, and debug."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Singleton Pattern and when should it be used?",
    "answer": "The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's implemented using a private constructor, static instance variable, and public getInstance() method. Common implementations include eager initialization (instance created at class loading), lazy initialization (instance created when first requested), and thread-safe versions using synchronization or static inner classes. Use Singleton for resources like database connections, loggers, or configuration managers where only one instance should exist."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the Factory Method Pattern with its key components.",
    "answer": "The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects created. Key components include: 1) Product interface - defines methods for all concrete products; 2) Concrete Products - implement the Product interface; 3) Creator abstract class - declares the factory method; 4) Concrete Creators - override the factory method to create specific products. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need for client code to know specific classes being instantiated."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Abstract Factory Pattern and how does it differ from Factory Method?",
    "answer": "The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It differs from Factory Method by creating multiple related products rather than just one. The pattern includes: 1) Abstract Factory interface with methods for each product type; 2) Concrete Factories implementing the interface; 3) Abstract Product interfaces; 4) Concrete Products implementing the interfaces. This pattern ensures that products from the same family are used together and supports adding new product families easily."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Builder Pattern solve the telescoping constructor problem?",
    "answer": "The Builder Pattern separates object construction from representation, solving the telescoping constructor problem where classes have multiple constructors with different parameter combinations. The pattern uses: 1) A static inner Builder class with methods for setting optional parameters; 2) Method chaining for fluent interface; 3) A build() method that creates the final object; 4) The main class with a private constructor taking the Builder. This makes object creation more readable, flexible, and allows for immutable objects with complex initialization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Prototype Pattern and when is it beneficial?",
    "answer": "The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying existing objects (prototypes) rather than instantiating from scratch. It's implemented using a clone() method that returns a copy of the object. This pattern is beneficial when: 1) Object creation is expensive; 2) You need objects similar to existing ones with minor differences; 3) You want to avoid subclassing; 4) The concrete classes are determined at runtime. The pattern reduces the cost of object creation and provides flexibility in object initialization."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are structural design patterns and what problems do they solve?",
    "answer": "Structural design patterns deal with object composition and help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change. They solve problems related to: 1) Combining objects and classes into larger structures; 2) Making incompatible interfaces work together; 3) Adding functionality without modifying existing code; 4) Simplifying complex subsystems; 5) Controlling access to objects; 6) Sharing common data efficiently. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Adapter Pattern enable incompatible interfaces to work together?",
    "answer": "The Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate by acting as a bridge between them. It consists of: 1) Target interface - what the client expects; 2) Adaptee class - existing class with different interface; 3) Adapter class - implements target interface and contains adaptee instance. The adapter translates calls from the target interface to the adaptee's interface. This pattern is useful for integrating legacy code, third-party libraries, or when you can't modify existing interfaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Bridge Pattern and how does it promote flexibility?",
    "answer": "The Bridge Pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. It consists of: 1) Abstraction - defines the interface and holds reference to implementor; 2) Refined Abstraction - extends the abstraction; 3) Implementor interface - defines implementation interface; 4) Concrete Implementors - provide specific implementations. This pattern is useful when you have multiple dimensions of variation (like shapes and colors) and want to avoid class explosion while maintaining flexibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Composite Pattern handle part-whole hierarchies?",
    "answer": "The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. The pattern includes: 1) Component interface - defines common operations; 2) Leaf - represents individual objects; 3) Composite - contains child components and implements operations by delegating to children. This pattern is useful for representing hierarchical structures like file systems, GUI components, or organizational structures where you need to treat individual items and groups the same way."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Decorator Pattern and how does it add behavior dynamically?",
    "answer": "The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to objects dynamically without altering their structure. It consists of: 1) Component interface - defines operations; 2) Concrete Component - basic implementation; 3) Decorator abstract class - implements component interface and has component reference; 4) Concrete Decorators - add specific behaviors. The pattern enables wrapping objects with additional functionality using composition rather than inheritance, following the Single Responsibility Principle and Open/Closed Principle."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Facade Pattern simplify complex subsystems?",
    "answer": "The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem by creating a unified interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. It consists of: 1) Facade class - provides simplified methods that delegate to subsystem classes; 2) Subsystem classes - implement complex functionality. The pattern hides subsystem complexity from clients, reduces dependencies between clients and subsystems, and provides a single entry point for subsystem functionality. It's commonly used in APIs, libraries, and complex system integrations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Flyweight Pattern and how does it optimize memory usage?",
    "answer": "The Flyweight Pattern minimizes memory usage by sharing common data among similar objects. It separates intrinsic state (shared data) from extrinsic state (unique data). The pattern includes: 1) Flyweight interface - declares methods that accept extrinsic state; 2) Concrete Flyweight - stores intrinsic state and implements interface; 3) Factory - manages flyweight instances and ensures sharing; 4) Context - passes extrinsic state to flyweight methods. This pattern is useful when dealing with large numbers of similar objects, like characters in text editors or particles in games."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Proxy Pattern control access to objects?",
    "answer": "The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It consists of: 1) Subject interface - defines common interface for RealSubject and Proxy; 2) RealSubject - the actual object being proxied; 3) Proxy - controls access to RealSubject and may add additional functionality. Common proxy types include: Virtual Proxy (lazy loading), Remote Proxy (remote objects), Protection Proxy (access control), and Caching Proxy (performance optimization). The pattern is useful for adding security, caching, or lazy initialization without modifying the original object."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are behavioral design patterns and what aspects of object interaction do they address?",
    "answer": "Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities. They address: 1) How objects interact and communicate; 2) Distribution of responsibilities among objects; 3) Algorithms and flow control; 4) Object collaboration patterns; 5) Encapsulation of behavior. These patterns help in making object interactions more flexible and efficient. Examples include Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Chain of Responsibility Pattern decouple senders from receivers?",
    "answer": "The Chain of Responsibility Pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one handles it. It consists of: 1) Handler interface/abstract class - defines handling method and next handler reference; 2) Concrete Handlers - implement specific handling logic; 3) Client - sends requests to the chain. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler. This pattern decouples senders from receivers, allows multiple objects to handle requests, and enables dynamic chain modification at runtime."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Command Pattern and how does it encapsulate requests?",
    "answer": "The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It includes: 1) Command interface - declares execution method; 2) Concrete Commands - implement interface and bind receiver with action; 3) Receiver - performs the actual work; 4) Invoker - holds command and invokes it; 5) Client - creates command and associates with receiver. This pattern enables undo/redo functionality, request queuing, logging, and macro recording while decoupling the invoker from the receiver."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Iterator Pattern provide sequential access to elements?",
    "answer": "The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It consists of: 1) Iterator interface - defines hasNext() and next() methods; 2) Concrete Iterator - implements traversal logic; 3) Aggregate interface - declares createIterator() method; 4) Concrete Aggregate - implements interface and returns iterator. This pattern separates collection traversal from the collection itself, supports multiple simultaneous traversals, and provides a uniform interface for different collection types."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Mediator Pattern and how does it reduce object dependencies?",
    "answer": "The Mediator Pattern allows objects to communicate without knowing each other's details by using a mediator object. It includes: 1) Mediator interface - defines communication protocol; 2) Concrete Mediator - coordinates communication between colleagues; 3) Colleague classes - communicate through mediator. This pattern promotes loose coupling by preventing direct object references, centralizes complex communications, and makes object interactions easier to understand and maintain. It's commonly used in GUI frameworks and chat applications."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Memento Pattern enable undo functionality?",
    "answer": "The Memento Pattern captures an object's internal state externally so it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. It consists of: 1) Memento - stores originator's state; 2) Originator - creates mementos and uses them to restore state; 3) Caretaker - stores mementos without modifying them. This pattern enables undo/redo functionality, state snapshots, and rollback capabilities while maintaining object encapsulation. It's commonly used in text editors, games, and applications requiring state management."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Observer Pattern and how does it implement publish-subscribe?",
    "answer": "The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified automatically. It includes: 1) Subject interface - manages observers and notifies them; 2) Concrete Subject - maintains state and notifies observers; 3) Observer interface - defines update method; 4) Concrete Observers - implement update to react to changes. This pattern implements the publish-subscribe model, supports broadcast communication, and promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the State Pattern manage object behavior based on internal state?",
    "answer": "The State Pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, making it appear as if the object changed its class. It consists of: 1) Context - maintains current state and delegates behavior to state object; 2) State interface - defines state-specific behavior; 3) Concrete States - implement behavior for specific states. This pattern eliminates complex conditional statements, makes state transitions explicit, and allows state-specific behavior to be easily modified or extended. It's commonly used in state machines and UI components."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Strategy Pattern and how does it enable algorithm selection at runtime?",
    "answer": "The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It consists of: 1) Strategy interface - defines algorithm interface; 2) Concrete Strategies - implement specific algorithms; 3) Context - uses strategy interface and maintains strategy reference. This pattern enables algorithm selection at runtime, eliminates conditional statements for algorithm selection, and makes it easy to add new algorithms. It's commonly used for sorting algorithms, payment processing, and validation strategies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the Template Method Pattern define algorithm structure?",
    "answer": "The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure. It consists of: 1) Abstract Class - defines template method and abstract steps; 2) Concrete Classes - implement abstract steps. The template method calls abstract methods in a specific order, creating the algorithm structure. This pattern promotes code reuse, ensures consistent algorithm structure, and allows customization of specific steps while maintaining overall flow."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Visitor Pattern and how does it separate algorithms from object structure?",
    "answer": "The Visitor Pattern allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It consists of: 1) Visitor interface - defines visit methods for each element type; 2) Concrete Visitors - implement specific operations; 3) Element interface - defines accept method; 4) Concrete Elements - implement accept to call appropriate visitor method. This pattern enables adding new operations without modifying existing classes, but makes adding new element types difficult. It's useful for operations on complex object structures like ASTs or document hierarchies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should you approach answering Low-Level Design interview problems?",
    "answer": "To effectively answer LLD interview problems: 1) Understand requirements by asking clarifying questions; 2) Define scope and identify key components; 3) Choose appropriate design patterns; 4) Create class diagrams with attributes, methods, and relationships; 5) Define relationships using composition vs inheritance; 6) Write pseudocode for core functionality; 7) Discuss scalability and extensibility; 8) Consider edge cases and error handling; 9) Review and iterate based on feedback; 10) Practice common problems like parking lots, libraries, and social media systems."
