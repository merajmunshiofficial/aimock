Low-level design (LLD) is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that focuses on the detailed design of individual components or modules of a system. It typically follows high-level design (HLD) and provides a more granular view of how the system will be implemented. Here are some key aspects of low-level design:

### Key Components of Low-Level Design

1. **Class Diagrams**: 
   - Define the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (inheritance, associations, etc.).
   - Specify access modifiers (public, private, protected) for class members.

2. **Sequence Diagrams**: 
   - Illustrate how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case.
   - Show the order of messages exchanged between objects.

3. **Data Structures**: 
   - Define the data structures to be used (arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables, etc.).
   - Specify how data will be stored, accessed, and manipulated.

4. **Algorithms**: 
   - Detail the algorithms that will be used for processing data (sorting, searching, etc.).
   - Include time and space complexity analysis.

5. **Interface Design**: 
   - Define the interfaces for modules and how they will communicate with each other.
   - Specify input and output formats.

6. **Error Handling**: 
   - Outline how errors will be managed within the system.
   - Define exception handling mechanisms.

7. **Database Design**: 
   - Provide details on database schema, tables, relationships, and constraints.
   - Specify queries and transactions.

8. **Configuration and Environment**: 
   - Describe the configuration settings required for the application.
   - Specify the environment in which the application will run (development, testing, production).

9. **Security Considerations**: 
   - Identify potential security risks and how they will be mitigated.
   - Define authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Best Practices for Low-Level Design

- **Modularity**: Design components to be modular and reusable.
- **Simplicity**: Keep designs simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Documentation**: Document the design thoroughly for future reference and maintenance.
- **Consistency**: Follow consistent naming conventions and design patterns.
- **Review and Feedback**: Conduct design reviews with peers to gather feedback and improve the design.

### Example of Low-Level Design

Suppose you are designing a simple library management system. Here’s a brief outline of what the low-level design might include:

- **Class Diagram**:
  - `Book` class with attributes like `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and methods like `checkOut()`, `returnBook()`.
  - `Member` class with attributes like `name`, `memberId`, and methods like `register()`, `borrowBook()`.

- **Sequence Diagram**:
  - A sequence diagram showing the interaction between `Member`, `Book`, and `Library` when a member borrows a book.

- **Data Structures**:
  - Use a list to store `Book` objects and a hash map to associate `memberId` with `Member` objects.

- **Database Design**:
  - Tables for `Books`, `Members`, and `Transactions` with appropriate foreign key relationships.

By focusing on these aspects, low-level design helps ensure that the system is built efficiently, is maintainable, and meets the specified requirements.


Low-level design (LLD) in Java involves several fundamental concepts that guide the creation of detailed designs for software components. Here are some of the key concepts to consider when performing low-level design in Java:

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
   - **Classes**: Define the blueprint for objects. In Java, classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
   - **Objects**: Instances of classes that hold specific data and can perform actions defined by their class.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
   - The practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
   - Access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) are used to restrict access to the class members, promoting data hiding.

### 3. **Inheritance**
   - A mechanism that allows one class (subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (superclass).
   - Promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
   - The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
   - Achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

### 5. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**
   - **Interfaces**: Define a contract that classes can implement. They can contain method signatures but no implementation (until Java 8, which introduced default methods).
   - **Abstract Classes**: Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). They cannot be instantiated directly.

### 6. **Composition**
   - A design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, establishing a "has-a" relationship.
   - Promotes flexibility and reusability by allowing classes to be built from existing components.

### 7. **Design Patterns**
   - Reusable solutions to common design problems. Some common design patterns in Java include:
     - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
     - **Factory**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects.
     - **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

### 8. **Exception Handling**
   - Mechanisms to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.
   - Custom exceptions can be created by extending the `Exception` class to handle specific error conditions.

### 9. **Collections Framework**
   - A set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Key components include:
     - **List**: An ordered collection (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`).
     - **Set**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements (e.g., `HashSet`, `TreeSet`).
     - **Map**: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., `HashMap`, `TreeMap`).

### 10. **Concurrency**
   - Managing multiple threads of execution in Java using the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface.
   - Synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` keyword, `Lock` interface) to prevent data inconsistency in multi-threaded environments.

### 11. **Java Annotations**
   - Metadata that provides data about a program but is not part of the program itself. Annotations can be used for various purposes, such as marking methods for testing or indicating that a method overrides a superclass method.

### 12. **Unit Testing**
   - Writing tests for individual components using frameworks like JUnit to ensure that each part of the application behaves as expected.

### Example of Low-Level Design in Java

Here’s a simple example of low-level design for a library management system:

```java
// Class representing a Book
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private String isbn;
    private boolean isCheckedOut;

    public Book(String title, String author, String isbn) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.isbn = isbn;
        this.isCheckedOut = false;
    }

    public void checkOut() {
        this.isCheckedOut = true;
    }

    public void returnBook() {
        this.isCheckedOut = false;
    }

    // Getters and other methods...
}

// Interface for Library operations
public interface LibraryOperations {
    void addBook(Book book);
    void removeBook(String isbn);
    Book findBook(String isbn);
}

// Class implementing LibraryOperations
public class Library implements LibraryOperations {
    private List<Book> books;

    public Library() {
        this.books = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeBook(String isbn) {
        books.removeIf(book -> book.getIsbn().equals(isbn));
    }

    @Override
    public Book findBook(String isbn) {
        for (Book book : books) {
            if (book.getIsbn().equals(isbn)) {
                return book;
            }
        }
        return null; // Book not found
    }
}

// Class representing a Library Member
public class Member {
    private String name;
    private String memberId;

    public Member(String name, String memberId) {
        this.name = name;
        this.memberId = memberId;
    }

    public void borrowBook(Library library, String isbn) {
        Book book = library.findBook(isbn);
        if (book != null && !book.isCheckedOut()) {
            book.checkOut();
            System.out.println(name + " borrowed " + book.getTitle());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Book is not available for borrowing.");
        }
    }

    // Getters and other methods...
}

// Example of using the classes
public class LibraryManagementSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();
        Book book1 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", "123456789");
        library.addBook(book1);

        Member member = new Member("Alice", "M001");
        member.borrowBook(library, "123456789");
    }
}
``` ### 13. **Dependency Injection**
   - A design pattern that allows for the decoupling of class dependencies, making it easier to manage and test components.
   - Frameworks like Spring provide built-in support for dependency injection.

### 14. **Service Layer**
   - A layer that encapsulates the business logic of the application, providing a clear separation between the presentation layer and the data access layer.
   - Facilitates transaction management and can coordinate multiple operations.

### 15. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**
   - Simple objects that carry data between processes, often used to aggregate data from multiple sources.
   - Helps in reducing the number of method calls and can improve performance.

### 16. **Configuration Management**
   - Managing application settings and configurations, often using properties files or environment variables.
   - Ensures that the application can be easily configured for different environments (development, testing, production).

### 17. **Logging**
   - Implementing logging mechanisms to track application behavior and errors.
   - Libraries like Log4j or SLF4J can be used to manage logging levels and outputs.

### 18. **Version Control**
   - Using version control systems (like Git) to manage changes to the codebase.
   - Facilitates collaboration among developers and helps in tracking the history of changes.

### 19. **Code Reviews**
   - Regularly reviewing code with peers to ensure quality and adherence to design principles.
   - Helps in identifying potential issues early in the development process.

### 20. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyzing and optimizing the performance of the application, focusing on areas like memory usage, response time, and resource management.
   - Profiling tools can be used to identify bottlenecks.

### Example of Dependency Injection in Java

```java
// Service class for managing library operations
public class LibraryService {
    private final Library library;

    // Constructor injection
    public LibraryService(Library library) {
        this.library = library;
    }

    public void addBook(Book book) {
        library.addBook(book);
    }

    public Book findBook(String isbn) {
        return library.findBook(isbn);
    }
}

// Main application class
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();
        LibraryService libraryService = new LibraryService(library);

        Book book1 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", "987654321");
        libraryService.addBook(book1);

        Book foundBook = libraryService.findBook("987654321");
        System.out.println("Found Book: " + foundBook.getTitle());
    }
}
```

By incorporating these fundamental concepts into low-level design, developers can create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications.


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several key concepts that help in organizing code in a more manageable and reusable way. Here are the basic OOP concepts, along with their application in low-level design in Java:

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class.

**Example in Java:**
```java
class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the car");
    }
}

// Creating an object
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.model = "Toyota";
myCar.drive();
```

### 2. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.

**Example in Java:**
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Inheritance**
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) can inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability.

**Example in Java:**
```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle started");
    }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void ride() {
        System.out.println("Riding the bike");
    }
}

// Using inheritance
Bike myBike = new Bike();
myBike.start(); // Inherited method
myBike.ride();  // Bike's own method
```

### 4. **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

**Example in Java:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

// Using polymorphism
Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
myAnimal.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks

myAnimal = new Cat();
myAnimal.sound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
```

### 5. **Abstraction**
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

**Example in Java:**
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

// Using abstraction
Shape myShape = new Circle();
myShape.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a circle
```

### Low-Level Design Considerations
When applying these OOP concepts in low-level design, consider the following:

- **Class Design**: Define clear responsibilities for each class. Use single responsibility principle (SRP) to ensure that a class has one reason to change.
- **Interface Segregation**: Create small, specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones.
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favor composition (using objects of other classes) over inheritance to achieve flexibility and reduce tight coupling.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilize design patterns (like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, etc.) to solve common design problems and improve code maintainability.

By understanding and applying these OOP concepts effectively, you can create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications.


The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are particularly useful in object-oriented programming. The acronym stands for:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Let's go through each principle with Java code examples.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job.

```java
// Violating SRP
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    public void saveUser () {
        // Code to save user to database
    }

    public void sendEmail() {
        // Code to send email
    }
}

// Following SRP
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Getters and Setters
}

class UserRepository {
    public void saveUser (User user) {
        // Code to save user to database
    }
}

class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(User user) {
        // Code to send email
    }
}
```

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

```java
// Violating OCP
class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Rectangle rectangle) {
        return rectangle.width * rectangle.height;
    }
}

// Following OCP
interface Shape {
    double area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public double radius;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
        return shape.area();
    }
}
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

```java
// Violating LSP
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        // Flying logic
    }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}

// Following LSP
interface Bird {
    void makeSound();
}

interface FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly();
}

class Sparrow implements FlyingBird {
    public void makeSound() {
        // Chirp
    }

    public void fly() {
        // Flying logic
    }
}

class Ostrich implements Bird {
    public void makeSound() {
        // Boom
    }
}
```

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

```java
// Violating ISP
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        // Working logic
    }

    public void eat() {
        // Eating logic
    }
}

class RobotWorker implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        // Working logic
    }

    public void eat() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robot can't eat");
    }
}

// Following ISP
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() {
        // Working logic
    }

    public void eat() {
        // Eating logic
    }
}

class RobotWorker implements Workable {
    public void work() {
        // Working logic
    }
}
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

```java
// Violating DIP
class LightBulb {
    public void turnOn() {
        // Turn on the light bulb
    }
}

class Switch {
    private LightBulb bulb;

    public Switch(LightBulb bulb) {
        this.bulb = bulb;
    }

    public void operate() {
        bulb.turnOn();
    }
}

// Following DIP
interface Switchable {
    void turnOn();
}

class LightBulb implements Switchable {
    public void turnOn() {
        // Turn on the light bulb
    }
}

class Switch {
    private Switchable device;

    public Switch(Switchable device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public void operate() {
        device.turnOn();
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

By adhering to the SOLID principles, you can create software that is easier to manage and extend over time. These principles help in reducing code complexity and improving code readability, making it easier for developers to work collaboratively and maintain the codebase. Implementing these principles in your Java applications can lead to better design choices and a more robust architecture.


The DRY principle, which stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," is a fundamental concept in software development that emphasizes the importance of reducing duplication in code. In the context of low-level design in Java, applying the DRY principle can lead to cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient code. Here’s how you can implement the DRY principle in low-level design in Java:

### 1. **Use Methods and Functions**
   - **Encapsulate Repeated Logic**: If you find yourself writing the same code multiple times, consider encapsulating that logic in a method. This way, you can call the method whenever needed instead of duplicating the code.
   ```java
   public class Calculator {
       public int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
       
       public int multiply(int a, int b) {
           return a * b;
       }
       
       public int addAndMultiply(int a, int b, int c) {
           return add(a, b) * c; // Reusing the add method
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Use Inheritance and Interfaces**
   - **Abstract Common Behavior**: If multiple classes share common behavior, consider using inheritance or interfaces to abstract that behavior. This allows you to define the common functionality in a base class or interface, reducing code duplication.
   ```java
   public interface Shape {
       double area();
   }

   public class Circle implements Shape {
       private double radius;

       public Circle(double radius) {
           this.radius = radius;
       }

       @Override
       public double area() {
           return Math.PI * radius * radius;
       }
   }

   public class Rectangle implements Shape {
       private double width;
       private double height;

       public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
           this.width = width;
           this.height = height;
       }

       @Override
       public double area() {
           return width * height;
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Use Composition Over Inheritance**
   - **Favor Composition**: Sometimes, using composition can help you avoid duplication by allowing you to reuse existing classes without creating a complex inheritance hierarchy.
   ```java
   public class Engine {
       public void start() {
           // Engine start logic
       }
   }

   public class Car {
       private Engine engine;

       public Car(Engine engine) {
           this.engine = engine;
       }

       public void start() {
           engine.start(); // Reusing Engine's start method
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. **Utilize Design Patterns**
   - **Implement Design Patterns**: Many design patterns, such as Singleton, Factory, and Strategy, promote the DRY principle by providing reusable solutions to common problems.
   ```java
   public class Singleton {
       private static Singleton instance;

       private Singleton() {}

       public static Singleton getInstance() {
           if (instance == null) {
               instance = new Singleton();
           }
           return instance;
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Use Utility Classes**
   - **Create Utility Classes**: For common operations that are used across different classes, consider creating utility classes with static methods.
   ```java
   public class MathUtils {
       public static int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
           return a * b;
       }
   }
   ```

### 6. **Refactor Regularly**
   - **Continuous Refactoring**: Regularly review and refactor your code to identify and eliminate duplication. This can be part of your development process, ensuring that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

### Conclusion
By adhering to the DRY principle in low-level design in Java, you can create a codebase that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. This not only improves the quality of your software but also enhances collaboration among team members, as the code becomes more intuitive and less error-prone.

The YAGNI principle, which stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It," is a key concept in software development, particularly in agile methodologies and extreme programming. It emphasizes that developers should not add functionality until it is necessary. This principle helps to avoid over-engineering, reduces complexity, and keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.

### Applying YAGNI in Low-Level Design in Java

When applying the YAGNI principle in low-level design, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Focus on Current Requirements**:
   - Design your classes and methods to meet the current requirements. Avoid adding features or methods that you think might be needed in the future.

   ```java
   public class User {
       private String username;
       private String password;

       public User(String username, String password) {
           this.username = username;
           this.password = password;
       }

       // Only include methods that are necessary for current functionality
       public String getUsername() {
           return username;
       }

       public String getPassword() {
           return password;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Avoid Premature Optimization**:
   - Don’t optimize your code for performance or scalability until you have identified a specific need. Focus on writing clear and maintainable code first.

3. **Keep Interfaces Simple**:
   - Design interfaces that are simple and only expose the methods that are necessary for the current functionality. Avoid adding methods that you think might be useful later.

   ```java
   public interface UserService {
       void createUser (User user);
       User getUser (String username);
   }
   ```

4. **Refactor When Necessary**:
   - If you find that you need additional functionality later, refactor your code at that time. This allows you to keep your design simple and focused.

5. **Use Feature Flags**:
   - If you are unsure about a feature, consider using feature flags to toggle functionality on and off. This allows you to implement features without fully committing to them until they are needed.

6. **Write Tests for Current Functionality**:
   - Ensure that you have tests for the current functionality. This will help you feel more confident when you decide to refactor or add new features later.

7. **Iterative Development**:
   - Embrace an iterative approach to development. Build small increments of functionality, and only add new features based on user feedback or changing requirements.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you are designing a simple e-commerce application. You might start with a basic `Product` class:

```java
public class Product {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private double price;

    public Product(String id, String name, double price) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}
```

Instead of adding methods for features like discounts, reviews, or inventory management right away, you would wait until those features are explicitly required by the stakeholders or users.

### Conclusion

By adhering to the YAGNI principle in low-level design, you can create a more maintainable and flexible codebase. It encourages developers to focus on the present needs of the application, reducing unnecessary complexity and making it easier to adapt to future requirements.

The KISS principle, which stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid," is a design philosophy that emphasizes simplicity in design and implementation. In the context of low-level design in Java, applying the KISS principle can lead to more maintainable, understandable, and efficient code. Here are some ways to apply the KISS principle in low-level design in Java:

### 1. **Avoid Over-Engineering**
   - **Keep Classes Focused**: Each class should have a single responsibility. Avoid adding unnecessary methods or properties that do not directly relate to the class's primary function.
   - **Limit Inheritance**: Prefer composition over inheritance. Use interfaces and composition to achieve flexibility without complicating the class hierarchy.

### 2. **Use Clear and Descriptive Naming**
   - **Meaningful Names**: Use clear and descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables. This helps others (and your future self) understand the purpose of each component without needing extensive documentation.
   - **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Follow Java naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for methods and variables, PascalCase for classes) to maintain consistency and readability.

### 3. **Simplify Method Design**
   - **Small Methods**: Keep methods small and focused on a single task. If a method is doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable methods.
   - **Clear Parameters**: Limit the number of parameters in methods. If a method requires many parameters, consider using an object to encapsulate them.

### 4. **Minimize Complexity**
   - **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Keep control structures (if statements, loops) shallow. Deeply nested code can be hard to read and maintain.
   - **Use Simple Data Structures**: Choose the simplest data structures that meet your needs. For example, use an `ArrayList` instead of a more complex structure if a list suffices.

### 5. **Error Handling**
   - **Simple Error Handling**: Use exceptions judiciously. Avoid complex error-handling logic that can obscure the main flow of the program. Handle exceptions at a higher level when possible.
   - **Clear Messages**: Provide clear and concise error messages that help diagnose issues without overwhelming the user or developer.

### 6. **Documentation and Comments**
   - **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that is self-explanatory. Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to explain why something is done, not what is done.
   - **Javadoc**: Use Javadoc comments for public classes and methods to provide clear documentation for users of your code.

### 7. **Testing**
   - **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your methods to ensure they work as intended. Simple methods are easier to test and debug.
   - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Consider using TDD to keep your design simple and focused on requirements.

### Example

Here’s a simple example illustrating the KISS principle in a Java class:

```java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two numbers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method to subtract two numbers
    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }

    // Method to multiply two numbers
    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    // Method to divide two numbers
    public double divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }
        return (double) a / b;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- Each method is small and focused on a single operation.
- The class has a clear purpose (a simple calculator).
- Error handling is straightforward, with a clear exception for division by zero.

By adhering to the KISS principle, you can create Java applications that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time.


Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and reusable. In Java, several creational design patterns are commonly used. Here are some of the most notable ones:

### 1. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Implementation:**
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 2. Factory Method Pattern
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Implementation:**
```java
interface Product {
    void use();
}

class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Product A");
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Product B");
    }
}

abstract class Creator {
    public abstract Product factoryMethod();
}

class ConcreteCreatorA extends Creator {
    public Product factoryMethod() {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

class ConcreteCreatorB extends Creator {
    public Product factoryMethod() {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
```

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Implementation:**
```java
interface AbstractProductA {
    void use();
}

interface AbstractProductB {
    void use();
}

class ConcreteProductA1 implements AbstractProductA {
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Product A1");
    }
}

class ConcreteProductB1 implements AbstractProductB {
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Product B1");
    }
}

interface AbstractFactory {
    AbstractProductA createProductA();
    AbstractProductB createProductB();
}

class ConcreteFactory1 implements AbstractFactory {
    public AbstractProductA createProductA() {
        return new ConcreteProductA1();
    }

    public AbstractProductB createProductB() {
        return new ConcreteProductB1();
    }
}
```

### 4. Builder Pattern
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Implementation:**
```java
class Product {
    private String partA;
    private String partB;

    public void setPartA(String partA) {
        this.partA = partA;
    }

    public void setPartB(String partB) {
        this.partB = partB;
    }
}

class Builder {
    private Product product;

    public Builder() {
        product = new Product();
    }

    public Builder buildPartA(String partA) {
        product.setPartA(partA);
        return this;
    }

    public Builder buildPartB(String partB) {
        product.setPartB(partB);
        return this;
    }

    public Product build() {
        return product;
    }
}
```

### 5. Prototype Pattern
The Prototype pattern is used to create a new object by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

**Implementation:**
```java
abstract class Prototype {
    public abstract Prototype clone();
}

class ConcretePrototype extends Prototype {
    private String field;

    public ConcretePrototype(String field) {
        this.field = field;
    }

    public String getField() {
        return field;
    }

    @Override
    public Prototype clone() {
        return new ConcretePrototype(this.field);
    }
}
```

### Summary
Creational design patterns in Java help manage object creation in a way that promotes flexibility and reuse. Each pattern has its own use cases and advantages, and understanding them can significantly improve the design of your applications. When implementing these patterns, consider the specific requirements of your project to choose the most appropriate one.


The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

### Key Characteristics of Singleton Pattern:
1. **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class is created.
2. **Global Access**: The instance is accessible globally.
3. **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created only when it is needed (optional).
4. **Thread Safety**: The implementation can be made thread-safe to handle concurrent access.

### Implementation in Java

Here’s a simple implementation of the Singleton Pattern in Java:

#### Eager Initialization

In this approach, the instance is created at the time of class loading.

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Eagerly create the instance
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Lazy Initialization

In this approach, the instance is created only when it is requested for the first time.

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Volatile variable to ensure visibility across threads
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Thread-Safe Singleton

The above lazy initialization can be made thread-safe using the double-checked locking pattern, as shown in the example above. This ensures that the instance is created only once, even when accessed by multiple threads.

### Bill Pugh Singleton Design

Another approach to implement the Singleton Pattern is using a static inner helper class. This method is thread-safe and does not require synchronization.

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    // Static inner class responsible for holding the Singleton instance
    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

### Usage Example

Here’s how you can use the Singleton class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        // Check if both references point to the same instance
        System.out.println(singleton1 == singleton2); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

The Singleton Pattern is a useful design pattern in Java for ensuring that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Depending on the requirements, you can choose between eager initialization, lazy initialization, or the Bill Pugh method for implementing the Singleton Pattern. Always consider thread safety when implementing Singleton in a multi-threaded environment.

The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need for the client code to know the specific classes that need to be instantiated.

### Key Characteristics of Factory Method Pattern:
1. **Encapsulation of Object Creation**: The creation logic is encapsulated in a method, allowing for flexibility in the types of objects created.
2. **Subclasses Decide**: Subclasses can override the factory method to create specific types of objects.
3. **Decoupling**: The client code is decoupled from the concrete classes, relying instead on abstractions.

### Implementation in Java

Here’s a simple implementation of the Factory Method Pattern in Java.

#### Step 1: Define the Product Interface

First, we define an interface that declares the methods that all concrete products will implement.

```java
public interface Product {
    void use();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Products

Next, we create concrete classes that implement the `Product` interface.

```java
public class ConcreteProductA implements Product {
    @Override
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Concrete Product A");
    }
}

public class ConcreteProductB implements Product {
    @Override
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Concrete Product B");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Creator Abstract Class

We create an abstract class that declares the factory method. This class may also provide some default implementation.

```java
public abstract class Creator {
    // The factory method
    public abstract Product factoryMethod();

    // Other methods can use the product
    public void someOperation() {
        Product product = factoryMethod();
        product.use();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Creators

Now, we create concrete classes that extend the `Creator` class and implement the factory method.

```java
public class ConcreteCreatorA extends Creator {
    @Override
    public Product factoryMethod() {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

public class ConcreteCreatorB extends Creator {
    @Override
    public Product factoryMethod() {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Client Code

Finally, we can use the factory method in the client code to create products without knowing their concrete classes.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Creator creatorA = new ConcreteCreatorA();
        creatorA.someOperation(); // Output: Using Concrete Product A

        Creator creatorB = new ConcreteCreatorB();
        creatorB.someOperation(); // Output: Using Concrete Product B
    }
}
```

### Summary

In this example, the `Creator` class defines the factory method `factoryMethod()`, which is overridden by the concrete creators (`ConcreteCreatorA` and `ConcreteCreatorB`) to instantiate specific products (`ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB`). The client code interacts with the `Creator` interface, allowing for flexibility and decoupling from the concrete product classes.

### Benefits of Factory Method Pattern
- **Flexibility**: New product types can be added without changing existing code.
- **Decoupling**: The client code does not need to know about the concrete classes.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The responsibility of creating objects is separated from the business logic.

### Conclusion

The Factory Method Pattern is a powerful design pattern that helps in creating objects while promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle. It is widely used in scenarios where the exact type of the object to be created is determined at runtime.

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when the system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

### Key Characteristics of Abstract Factory Pattern:
1. **Family of Products**: It allows the creation of a set of related products.
2. **Encapsulation of Object Creation**: The creation logic is encapsulated in factory classes.
3. **Decoupling**: The client code is decoupled from the concrete classes, relying instead on abstractions.

### Implementation in Java

Here’s a simple implementation of the Abstract Factory Pattern in Java.

#### Step 1: Define Product Interfaces

First, we define interfaces for the products that will be created by the factories.

```java
// Product A interface
public interface ProductA {
    void use();
}

// Product B interface
public interface ProductB {
    void use();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Products

Next, we create concrete classes that implement the product interfaces.

```java
// Concrete Product A1
public class ConcreteProductA1 implements ProductA {
    @Override
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Concrete Product A1");
    }
}

// Concrete Product A2
public class ConcreteProductA2 implements ProductA {
    @Override
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Concrete Product A2");
    }
}

// Concrete Product B1
public class ConcreteProductB1 implements ProductB {
    @Override
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Concrete Product B1");
    }
}

// Concrete Product B2
public class ConcreteProductB2 implements ProductB {
    @Override
    public void use() {
        System.out.println("Using Concrete Product B2");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define Abstract Factory Interface

We create an interface for the abstract factory that declares methods for creating the products.

```java
public interface AbstractFactory {
    ProductA createProductA();
    ProductB createProductB();
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Factories

Now, we create concrete factories that implement the abstract factory interface.

```java
// Concrete Factory 1
public class ConcreteFactory1 implements AbstractFactory {
    @Override
    public ProductA createProductA() {
        return new ConcreteProductA1();
    }

    @Override
    public ProductB createProductB() {
        return new ConcreteProductB1();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory 2
public class ConcreteFactory2 implements AbstractFactory {
    @Override
    public ProductA createProductA() {
        return new ConcreteProductA2();
    }

    @Override
    public ProductB createProductB() {
        return new ConcreteProductB2();
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Client Code

Finally, we can use the abstract factory in the client code to create products without knowing their concrete classes.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractFactory factory1 = new ConcreteFactory1();
        ProductA productA1 = factory1.createProductA();
        ProductB productB1 = factory1.createProductB();
        
        productA1.use(); // Output: Using Concrete Product A1
        productB1.use(); // Output: Using Concrete Product B1

        AbstractFactory factory2 = new ConcreteFactory2();
        ProductA productA2 = factory2.createProductA();
        ProductB productB2 = factory2.createProductB();
        
        productA2.use(); // Output: Using Concrete Product A2
        productB2.use(); // Output: Using Concrete Product B2
    }
}
```

### Summary

In this example, the `AbstractFactory` interface defines methods for creating products of type `ProductA` and `ProductB`. The concrete factories (`ConcreteFactory1` and `ConcreteFactory2`) implement these methods to create specific products. The client code interacts with the abstract factory interface, allowing for flexibility and decoupling from the concrete product classes.

### Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Consistency**: Ensures that products from the same family are used together.
- **Flexibility**: New families of products can be added without changing existing code.
- **Decoupling**: The client code does not need to know about the concrete classes.

### Conclusion

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a powerful design pattern that helps in creating families of related objects while promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle. It is widely used in scenarios where a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. It is particularly useful when an object requires many parameters for its construction, some of which may be optional. The Builder Pattern helps to avoid constructor telescoping (having multiple constructors with different parameters) and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

### Key Components of the Builder Pattern

1. **Product**: The complex object that is being built.
2. **Builder**: An interface or abstract class that defines the methods for creating the parts of the Product.
3. **ConcreteBuilder**: A class that implements the Builder interface and provides specific implementations for the building steps.
4. **Director**: A class that constructs the object using the Builder interface. It defines the order in which to call the building methods.

### Example in Java

Let's create a simple example of a `Pizza` class using the Builder Pattern.

#### Step 1: Define the Product

```java
public class Pizza {
    private final String size; // required
    private final boolean cheese; // optional
    private final boolean pepperoni; // optional
    private final boolean mushrooms; // optional

    private Pizza(PizzaBuilder builder) {
        this.size = builder.size;
        this.cheese = builder.cheese;
        this.pepperoni = builder.pepperoni;
        this.mushrooms = builder.mushrooms;
    }

    public static class PizzaBuilder {
        private final String size; // required
        private boolean cheese; // optional
        private boolean pepperoni; // optional
        private boolean mushrooms; // optional

        public PizzaBuilder(String size) {
            this.size = size;
        }

        public PizzaBuilder addCheese() {
            this.cheese = true;
            return this;
        }

        public PizzaBuilder addPepperoni() {
            this.pepperoni = true;
            return this;
        }

        public PizzaBuilder addMushrooms() {
            this.mushrooms = true;
            return this;
        }

        public Pizza build() {
            return new Pizza(this);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Pizza{" +
                "size='" + size + '\'' +
                ", cheese=" + cheese +
                ", pepperoni=" + pepperoni +
                ", mushrooms=" + mushrooms +
                '}';
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Using the Builder

Now, let's see how to use the `PizzaBuilder` to create a `Pizza` object.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pizza pizza = new Pizza.PizzaBuilder("Large")
                .addCheese()
                .addPepperoni()
                .build();

        System.out.println(pizza);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Product Class (`Pizza`)**: This class has a private constructor that takes a `PizzaBuilder` object. It has fields for size, cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms, with the size being required and the others being optional.

2. **Builder Class (`PizzaBuilder`)**: This inner static class allows for the construction of a `Pizza` object. It has methods to set optional parameters and a `build()` method that creates the `Pizza` object.

3. **Usage**: In the `Main` class, we create a `Pizza` object using the `PizzaBuilder`. We specify the size and add optional toppings using method chaining.

### Benefits of the Builder Pattern

- **Readability**: The code is more readable and self-explanatory.
- **Immutability**: The `Pizza` object can be made immutable since all fields are final and set only once during construction.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add new optional parameters without changing the existing code.

### Conclusion

The Builder Pattern is a powerful design pattern that simplifies the creation of complex objects in Java. It enhances code readability and maintainability, making it a popular choice in low-level design.

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance of an object is more expensive than copying an existing instance. 

In Java, the Prototype Pattern can be implemented using the `Cloneable` interface and the `clone()` method. Below is a simple example to illustrate the Prototype Pattern in Java.

### Step 1: Create the Prototype Interface

First, we define a `Prototype` interface that declares a `clone` method.

```java
public interface Prototype {
    Prototype clone();
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Prototypes

Next, we create concrete classes that implement the `Prototype` interface. Each class will implement the `clone` method to return a copy of itself.

```java
public class ConcretePrototypeA implements Prototype {
    private String fieldA;

    public ConcretePrototypeA(String fieldA) {
        this.fieldA = fieldA;
    }

    public String getFieldA() {
        return fieldA;
    }

    @Override
    public Prototype clone() {
        return new ConcretePrototypeA(this.fieldA);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "ConcretePrototypeA{" +
                "fieldA='" + fieldA + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}

public class ConcretePrototypeB implements Prototype {
    private int fieldB;

    public ConcretePrototypeB(int fieldB) {
        this.fieldB = fieldB;
    }

    public int getFieldB() {
        return fieldB;
    }

    @Override
    public Prototype clone() {
        return new ConcretePrototypeB(this.fieldB);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "ConcretePrototypeB{" +
                "fieldB=" + fieldB +
                '}';
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Prototype

Now, we can use the prototypes to create new instances by cloning existing ones.

```java
public class PrototypePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create original objects
        ConcretePrototypeA prototypeA = new ConcretePrototypeA("Prototype A");
        ConcretePrototypeB prototypeB = new ConcretePrototypeB(100);

        // Clone the objects
        ConcretePrototypeA clonedA = (ConcretePrototypeA) prototypeA.clone();
        ConcretePrototypeB clonedB = (ConcretePrototypeB) prototypeB.clone();

        // Display the original and cloned objects
        System.out.println("Original: " + prototypeA);
        System.out.println("Cloned: " + clonedA);

        System.out.println("Original: " + prototypeB);
        System.out.println("Cloned: " + clonedB);
    }
}
```

### Output

When you run the `PrototypePatternDemo`, you will see output similar to the following:

```
Original: ConcretePrototypeA{fieldA='Prototype A'}
Cloned: ConcretePrototypeA{fieldA='Prototype A'}
Original: ConcretePrototypeB{fieldB=100}
Cloned: ConcretePrototypeB{fieldB=100}
```

### Summary

In this example, we defined a `Prototype` interface and two concrete classes that implement this interface. Each class has a `clone` method that creates a new instance of itself. The `PrototypePatternDemo` class demonstrates how to use the Prototype Pattern to create new objects by cloning existing ones.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation is costly, and you want to avoid the overhead of instantiation by reusing existing objects.



Structural design patterns are design patterns that deal with object composition, helping to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change. They focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Here are some common structural design patterns in Java, along with brief explanations and examples:

### 1. Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

**Example:**
```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee class
class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Specific request.");
    }
}

// Adapter class
class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        Target target = new Adapter(adaptee);
        target.request(); // Output: Specific request.
    }
}
```

### 2. Bridge Pattern
The Bridge Pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.

**Example:**
```java
// Implementor interface
interface Implementor {
    void operation();
}

// ConcreteImplementor
class ConcreteImplementorA implements Implementor {
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteImplementorA operation.");
    }
}

// Abstraction
abstract class Abstraction {
    protected Implementor implementor;

    protected Abstraction(Implementor implementor) {
        this.implementor = implementor;
    }

    public abstract void operation();
}

// RefinedAbstraction
class RefinedAbstraction extends Abstraction {
    public RefinedAbstraction(Implementor implementor) {
        super(implementor);
    }

    public void operation() {
        implementor.operation();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Implementor implementor = new ConcreteImplementorA();
        Abstraction abstraction = new RefinedAbstraction(implementor);
        abstraction.operation(); // Output: ConcreteImplementorA operation.
    }
}
```

### 3. Composite Pattern
The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Example:**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component interface
interface Component {
    void operation();
}

// Leaf class
class Leaf implements Component {
    private String name;

    public Leaf(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("Leaf: " + name);
    }
}

// Composite class
class Composite implements Component {
    private List<Component> children = new ArrayList<>();

    public void add(Component component) {
        children.add(component);
    }

    public void remove(Component component) {
        children.remove(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void operation() {
        for (Component child : children) {
            child.operation();
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Composite composite = new Composite();
        composite.add(new Leaf("Leaf 1"));
        composite.add(new Leaf("Leaf 2"));

        Composite composite2 = new Composite();
        composite2.add(new Leaf("Leaf 3"));
        composite2.add(composite); // Adding a composite to another composite

        composite2.operation(); // Output: Leaf: Leaf 3, Leaf: Leaf 1, Leaf: Leaf 2
    }
}
```

### 4. Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

**Example:**
```java
// Component interface
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double cost();
}

// ConcreteComponent
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple coffee";
    }

    public double cost() {
        return 2.0;
    }
}

// Decorator class
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription();
    }

    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost();
    }
}

// ConcreteDecorator
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", milk";
    }

    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 0.5;
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());

        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());
    }
}
```

### 5. Facade Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

**Example:**
```java
// Subsystem classes
class SubsystemA {
    public void operationA() {
        System.out.println("Subsystem A operation.");
    }
}

class SubsystemB {
    public void operationB() {
        System.out.println("Subsystem B operation.");
    }
}

// Facade class
class Facade {
    private SubsystemA subsystemA;
    private SubsystemB subsystemB;

    public Facade() {
        subsystemA = new SubsystemA();
        subsystemB = new SubsystemB();
    }

    public void operation() {
        subsystemA.operationA();
        subsystemB.operationB();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Facade facade = new Facade();
        facade.operation(); // Output: Subsystem A operation. Subsystem B operation.
    }
}
```

### 6. Proxy Pattern
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Example:**
```java
// Subject interface
interface Subject {
    void request();
}

// RealSubject class
class RealSubject implements Subject {
    public void request() {
        System.out.println("RealSubject request.");
    }
}

// Proxy class
class Proxy implements Subject {
    private RealSubject realSubject;

    public void request() {
        if (realSubject == null) {
            realSubject = new RealSubject();
        }
        realSubject.request();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Subject proxy = new Proxy();
        proxy.request(); // Output: RealSubject request.
    }
}
```

These patterns help in creating flexible and reusable object-oriented software. Each pattern serves a specific purpose and can be used in various scenarios to improve code organization and maintainability.


The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to integrate new functionality into an existing system without modifying the existing code.

### Key Components of the Adapter Pattern

1. **Target Interface**: This is the interface that the client expects to work with.
2. **Adaptee Class**: This is the existing class that has a different interface that needs to be adapted.
3. **Adapter Class**: This class implements the target interface and translates the requests from the target interface to the adaptee's interface.

### Example of the Adapter Pattern in Java

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `Bird` interface that our client code expects, but we have an existing `Duck` class that does not implement this interface. We will create an adapter to allow the `Duck` to be used as a `Bird`.

#### Step 1: Define the Target Interface

```java
// Target interface
interface Bird {
    void fly();
    void makeSound();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Adaptee Class

```java
// Adaptee class
class Duck {
    public void quack() {
        System.out.println("Quack!");
    }

    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck is swimming.");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Adapter Class

```java
// Adapter class
class DuckAdapter implements Bird {
    private Duck duck;

    public DuckAdapter(Duck duck) {
        this.duck = duck;
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck is flying a short distance.");
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        duck.quack(); // Delegate the call to the Duck's quack method
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

```java
// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Duck duck = new Duck();
        Bird duckAdapter = new DuckAdapter(duck);

        // Using the adapter as a Bird
        duckAdapter.fly(); // Output: Duck is flying a short distance.
        duckAdapter.makeSound(); // Output: Quack!
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Target Interface (`Bird`)**: This interface defines the methods that the client code expects to use.
2. **Adaptee Class (`Duck`)**: This class has its own methods (`quack` and `swim`) that do not match the `Bird` interface.
3. **Adapter Class (`DuckAdapter`)**: This class implements the `Bird` interface and contains an instance of `Duck`. It translates the `fly` and `makeSound` calls to the appropriate methods of the `Duck` class.
4. **Client Code**: The client code interacts with the `Bird` interface, using the `DuckAdapter` to work with a `Duck` object seamlessly.

### Benefits of the Adapter Pattern

- **Reusability**: You can reuse existing classes without modifying their code.
- **Flexibility**: You can adapt multiple classes to the same interface.
- **Decoupling**: The client code is decoupled from the specific implementations of the adaptee classes.

### Use Cases

- When you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match the one you need.
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.
- When you want to create a wrapper for a class to provide a different interface.

The Adapter Pattern is a powerful tool in low-level design, allowing for greater flexibility and integration of different components in a system.


The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to separate an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This is particularly useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, which can lead to a proliferation of classes.

### Key Components of the Bridge Pattern

1. **Abstraction**: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the abstraction's interface.
2. **Refined Abstraction**: This is a subclass of the Abstraction that extends its functionality.
3. **Implementor**: This is the interface that defines the implementation's interface.
4. **Concrete Implementor**: This is a class that implements the Implementor interface.

### Example in Java

Let's consider an example where we want to create a drawing application that can draw shapes in different colors. We can use the Bridge Pattern to separate the shape abstraction from the color implementation.

#### Step 1: Define the Implementor Interface

```java
// Implementor
interface Color {
    void applyColor();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Implementors

```java
// Concrete Implementor
class RedColor implements Color {
    @Override
    public void applyColor() {
        System.out.println("Applying red color.");
    }
}

// Concrete Implementor
class GreenColor implements Color {
    @Override
    public void applyColor() {
        System.out.println("Applying green color.");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Abstraction

```java
// Abstraction
abstract class Shape {
    protected Color color;

    protected Shape(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    abstract void draw();
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Refined Abstractions

```java
// Refined Abstraction
class Circle extends Shape {
    public Circle(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.print("Drawing Circle. ");
        color.applyColor();
    }
}

// Refined Abstraction
class Square extends Shape {
    public Square(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.print("Drawing Square. ");
        color.applyColor();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Client Code

```java
public class BridgePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape redCircle = new Circle(new RedColor());
        Shape greenSquare = new Square(new GreenColor());

        redCircle.draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle. Applying red color.
        greenSquare.draw(); // Output: Drawing Square. Applying green color.
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Color** is the Implementor interface that defines the method `applyColor()`.
2. **RedColor** and **GreenColor** are concrete implementations of the Color interface.
3. **Shape** is the Abstraction that holds a reference to a Color object.
4. **Circle** and **Square** are refined abstractions that implement the `draw()` method, which uses the Color implementation to apply color.
5. In the `BridgePatternDemo`, we create instances of `Circle` and `Square` with different colors and call their `draw()` methods.

### Benefits of the Bridge Pattern

- **Decoupling**: It decouples the abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Flexibility**: You can change the implementation without affecting the abstraction and vice versa.
- **Reduced Class Explosion**: It helps in reducing the number of classes that need to be created when you have multiple variations of both the abstraction and the implementation.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you have multiple dimensions of variation, such as different shapes and different colors in this example.


The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is particularly useful when you want to represent a hierarchy of objects where both individual objects and compositions of objects can be treated the same way.

### Key Components of the Composite Pattern

1. **Component**: An interface or abstract class that defines the common interface for all concrete objects and their compositions.
2. **Leaf**: A concrete class that implements the Component interface. It represents the leaf nodes in the composition (i.e., individual objects).
3. **Composite**: A concrete class that implements the Component interface and contains child components (which can be either Leaf or Composite). It defines methods to add, remove, and access child components.

### Example in Java

Let's create a simple example of a file system where we can have files and directories. Both files and directories can be treated as components.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component
interface FileSystemComponent {
    void showDetails();
}

// Leaf
class File implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;
    private int size; // Size in KB

    public File(String name, int size) {
        this.name = name;
        this.size = size;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name + " (Size: " + size + " KB)");
    }
}

// Composite
class Directory implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<FileSystemComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();

    public Directory(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void addComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.add(component);
    }

    public void removeComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : components) {
            component.showDetails();
        }
    }
}

// Client
public class CompositePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create files
        File file1 = new File("File1.txt", 10);
        File file2 = new File("File2.txt", 20);
        File file3 = new File("File3.txt", 30);

        // Create directories
        Directory dir1 = new Directory("Directory1");
        Directory dir2 = new Directory("Directory2");

        // Add files to directories
        dir1.addComponent(file1);
        dir1.addComponent(file2);
        dir2.addComponent(file3);

        // Create a root directory and add subdirectories
        Directory rootDirectory = new Directory("RootDirectory");
        rootDirectory.addComponent(dir1);
        rootDirectory.addComponent(dir2);

        // Show details of the root directory
        rootDirectory.showDetails();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **FileSystemComponent**: This is the component interface that declares the `showDetails` method.
2. **File**: This class implements the `FileSystemComponent` interface and represents a file in the file system.
3. **Directory**: This class also implements the `FileSystemComponent` interface and can contain other `FileSystemComponent` objects (both files and directories). It provides methods to add and remove components.
4. **CompositePatternDemo**: This is the client code that demonstrates the use of the Composite Pattern. It creates a hierarchy of files and directories and displays their details.

### Benefits of the Composite Pattern

- **Simplifies Client Code**: Clients can treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Easier to Add New Components**: New types of components can be added without changing existing code.
- **Encourages a Recursive Structure**: The pattern naturally supports recursive structures, which can be useful in many applications.

### Use Cases

- File systems
- GUI frameworks (where components can contain other components)
- Organization structures (like departments and employees)

The Composite Pattern is a powerful tool in low-level design, especially when dealing with hierarchical data structures.

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.

### Key Components of the Decorator Pattern

1. **Component**: An interface or abstract class defining the operations that can be dynamically added to concrete components.
2. **Concrete Component**: A class that implements the Component interface. This is the object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
3. **Decorator**: An abstract class that implements the Component interface and has a reference to a Component object. It delegates the operations to the wrapped component.
4. **Concrete Decorators**: Classes that extend the Decorator class and add additional responsibilities or behaviors.

### Example in Java

Let's illustrate the Decorator Pattern with a simple example of a coffee shop where we can add different condiments to a coffee.

#### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

```java
public interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double cost();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a Concrete Component

```java
public class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return 2.00; // Base cost of simple coffee
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Decorator Class

```java
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Decorators

```java
public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 0.50; // Adding cost of milk
    }
}

public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 0.20; // Adding cost of sugar
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Using the Decorator Pattern

```java
public class CoffeeShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());

        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());

        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Simple Coffee $2.0
Simple Coffee, Milk $2.5
Simple Coffee, Milk, Sugar $2.7
```

### Explanation

1. **Component Interface**: `Coffee` defines the methods `getDescription()` and `cost()`.
2. **Concrete Component**: `SimpleCoffee` implements the `Coffee` interface.
3. **Decorator Class**: `CoffeeDecorator` implements the `Coffee` interface and holds a reference to a `Coffee` object.
4. **Concrete Decorators**: `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` extend `CoffeeDecorator` and add their specific behavior.
5. **Usage**: In the `CoffeeShop` class, we create a `SimpleCoffee` and then decorate it with `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator`, demonstrating how we can dynamically add responsibilities.

### Benefits of the Decorator Pattern

- **Flexibility**: You can add or remove responsibilities at runtime.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility, making the code easier to manage and extend.
- **Avoids Class Explosion**: Instead of creating a new subclass for every combination of behaviors, you can combine decorators as needed.

This pattern is widely used in Java, especially in GUI frameworks (like Swing) and in the Java I/O classes.

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and provides a simpler interface to the client. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Key Concepts of the Facade Pattern:
1. **Facade**: The main class that clients interact with. It provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem.
2. **Subsystem Classes**: The classes that implement the complex functionality. The facade delegates calls to these classes.

### Benefits of the Facade Pattern:
- Simplifies the interface for the client.
- Reduces the dependencies between the client and the subsystem.
- Makes the subsystem easier to use and understand.

### Example in Java

Let's consider a scenario where we have a home theater system with various components like a DVD player, projector, and sound system. We will create a facade to simplify the interaction with these components.

#### Step 1: Create Subsystem Classes

```java
// DVD Player
class DVDPlayer {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player is on");
    }

    public void play(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Playing movie: " + movie);
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Stopping movie");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player is off");
    }
}

// Projector
class Projector {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Projector is on");
    }

    public void setInput(String input) {
        System.out.println("Setting input to: " + input);
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Projector is off");
    }
}

// Sound System
class SoundSystem {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Sound System is on");
    }

    public void setVolume(int level) {
        System.out.println("Setting volume to: " + level);
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Sound System is off");
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Facade Class

```java
class HomeTheaterFacade {
    private DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
    private Projector projector;
    private SoundSystem soundSystem;

    public HomeTheaterFacade(DVDPlayer dvdPlayer, Projector projector, SoundSystem soundSystem) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        this.projector = projector;
        this.soundSystem = soundSystem;
    }

    public void watchMovie(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Get ready to watch a movie...");
        projector.on();
        projector.setInput("DVD");
        soundSystem.on();
        soundSystem.setVolume(5);
        dvdPlayer.on();
        dvdPlayer.play(movie);
    }

    public void endMovie() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down the home theater...");
        dvdPlayer.stop();
        dvdPlayer.off();
        soundSystem.off();
        projector.off();
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Client Code

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DVDPlayer dvdPlayer = new DVDPlayer();
        Projector projector = new Projector();
        SoundSystem soundSystem = new SoundSystem();

        HomeTheaterFacade homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade(dvdPlayer, projector, soundSystem);

        homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception");
        homeTheater.endMovie();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Subsystem Classes**: `DVDPlayer`, `Projector`, and `SoundSystem` represent the complex parts of the home theater system.
2. **Facade Class**: `HomeTheaterFacade` provides a simple interface for the client to interact with the subsystem. It encapsulates the complexity of starting and stopping the home theater system.
3. **Client Code**: The client creates instances of the subsystem classes and passes them to the facade. It then calls the `watchMovie` and `endMovie` methods to control the home theater system without needing to understand the details of each component.

### Conclusion
The Facade Pattern is a powerful way to simplify interactions with complex systems. By using a facade, you can reduce the complexity of the client code and make it easier to work with the underlying subsystems.


The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage by sharing common data among similar objects. It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have some shared state. Instead of creating a new object for each instance, the Flyweight Pattern allows you to create a single shared object and reuse it.

### Key Concepts

1. **Flyweight**: The shared object that contains the intrinsic state (shared data).
2. **Context**: The extrinsic state (unique data) that is passed to the Flyweight object when it is used.
3. **Factory**: A factory class that manages the creation and sharing of Flyweight objects.

### Example Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where we are creating a text editor that uses different characters. Instead of creating a new object for each character, we can use the Flyweight Pattern to share character objects.

### Implementation in Java

Here's a simple implementation of the Flyweight Pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

// Flyweight interface
interface Character {
    void display(int fontSize);
}

// Concrete Flyweight
class ConcreteCharacter implements Character {
    private final char symbol; // Intrinsic state

    public ConcreteCharacter(char symbol) {
        this.symbol = symbol;
    }

    @Override
    public void display(int fontSize) {
        System.out.println("Character: " + symbol + ", Font Size: " + fontSize);
    }
}

// Flyweight Factory
class CharacterFactory {
    private final Map<Character, Character> characters = new HashMap<>();

    public Character getCharacter(char symbol) {
        Character character = characters.get(symbol);
        if (character == null) {
            character = new ConcreteCharacter(symbol);
            characters.put(symbol, character);
        }
        return character;
    }
}

// Client code
public class FlyweightPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CharacterFactory factory = new CharacterFactory();

        // Creating characters
        Character a = factory.getCharacter('A');
        Character b = factory.getCharacter('B');
        Character c = factory.getCharacter('C');

        // Displaying characters with different font sizes
        a.display(12);
        a.display(14);
        b.display(12);
        c.display(10);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Character Interface**: This defines the method `display(int fontSize)` that all concrete characters will implement.
  
2. **ConcreteCharacter Class**: This class implements the `Character` interface and holds the intrinsic state (the character symbol). The `display` method prints the character along with the font size.

3. **CharacterFactory Class**: This factory class manages the creation and sharing of `ConcreteCharacter` objects. It uses a `HashMap` to store already created characters, ensuring that only one instance of each character is created.

4. **Client Code**: In the `FlyweightPatternDemo` class, we create a `CharacterFactory` and request characters. The factory returns shared instances of characters, demonstrating the Flyweight Pattern.

### Benefits

- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common objects.
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduces the overhead of creating and managing a large number of similar objects.

### Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: The pattern can introduce complexity in the codebase, especially when managing shared and unique states.
- **Thread Safety**: Care must be taken to ensure that shared objects are thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment.

The Flyweight Pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you have a large number of similar objects, such as in graphics rendering, text processing, or any situation where memory efficiency is critical.

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object. It acts as an intermediary, controlling access to the original object. This pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to add an additional layer of control, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or remote method invocation.

### Components of the Proxy Pattern

1. **Subject Interface**: This defines the common interface for both the RealSubject and Proxy.
2. **RealSubject**: This is the actual object that the Proxy represents. It contains the real implementation of the functionality.
3. **Proxy**: This class implements the Subject interface and holds a reference to the RealSubject. It controls access to the RealSubject and can add additional functionality.

### Example in Java

Let's illustrate the Proxy Pattern with a simple example where we have a `Image` interface, a `RealImage` class that implements the interface, and a `ProxyImage` class that controls access to the `RealImage`.

#### Step 1: Define the Subject Interface

```java
public interface Image {
    void display();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the RealSubject

```java
public class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadImageFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadImageFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + filename);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + filename);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Proxy

```java
public class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private RealImage realImage;
    private String filename;

    public ProxyImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

```java
public class ProxyPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image1 = new ProxyImage("photo1.jpg");
        Image image2 = new ProxyImage("photo2.jpg");

        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image1.display();
        System.out.println("");

        // Image will not be loaded from disk
        image1.display();
        System.out.println("");

        // Image will be loaded from disk
        image2.display();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Image Interface**: This defines the `display` method that both `RealImage` and `ProxyImage` will implement.
2. **RealImage Class**: This class implements the `Image` interface and contains the actual image loading logic. The image is loaded from disk when the `RealImage` is instantiated.
3. **ProxyImage Class**: This class also implements the `Image` interface but holds a reference to a `RealImage`. It delays the instantiation of `RealImage` until the `display` method is called for the first time (lazy loading).
4. **Client Code**: The client code demonstrates how to use the `ProxyImage`. The first call to `display` on `image1` loads the image from disk, while subsequent calls do not.

### Benefits of the Proxy Pattern

- **Lazy Initialization**: The real object is created only when it is needed.
- **Access Control**: The proxy can control access to the real object.
- **Additional Functionality**: The proxy can add additional behavior (like logging or caching) without modifying the real object.

### Use Cases

- **Virtual Proxy**: For objects that are expensive to create, such as images or videos.
- **Remote Proxy**: For objects that are located on a different server.
- **Protection Proxy**: To control access to the real object based on user permissions.

The Proxy Pattern is a powerful tool in low-level design, allowing for flexible and maintainable code.

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately handle it.

### Components of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

1. **Handler Interface**: This defines a method for handling requests and a method for setting the next handler in the chain.
2. **Concrete Handlers**: These are classes that implement the handler interface and define specific handling logic.
3. **Client**: The client sends requests to the chain of handlers.

### Example in Java

Let's illustrate the Chain of Responsibility Pattern with an example where we have a system that processes support requests of different severity levels.

#### Step 1: Define the Handler Interface

```java
public abstract class SupportHandler {
    protected SupportHandler nextHandler;

    public void setNextHandler(SupportHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    public abstract void handleRequest(String request);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Handlers

```java
public class LowLevelSupport extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equalsIgnoreCase("low")) {
            System.out.println("LowLevelSupport handling request: " + request);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

public class MediumLevelSupport extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equalsIgnoreCase("medium")) {
            System.out.println("MediumLevelSupport handling request: " + request);
        } else if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }
}

public class HighLevelSupport extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String request) {
        if (request.equalsIgnoreCase("high")) {
            System.out.println("HighLevelSupport handling request: " + request);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Request not handled: " + request);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Client Code

```java
public class ChainOfResponsibilityDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create handlers
        SupportHandler lowLevel = new LowLevelSupport();
        SupportHandler mediumLevel = new MediumLevelSupport();
        SupportHandler highLevel = new HighLevelSupport();

        // Set up the chain
        lowLevel.setNextHandler(mediumLevel);
        mediumLevel.setNextHandler(highLevel);

        // Client requests
        lowLevel.handleRequest("low");
        lowLevel.handleRequest("medium");
        lowLevel.handleRequest("high");
        lowLevel.handleRequest("urgent"); // Not handled
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Handler Interface**: The `SupportHandler` abstract class defines the method `handleRequest` for handling requests and a method `setNextHandler` for setting the next handler in the chain.
2. **Concrete Handlers**: 
   - `LowLevelSupport` handles requests marked as "low".
   - `MediumLevelSupport` handles requests marked as "medium".
   - `HighLevelSupport` handles requests marked as "high". If none of the handlers can handle the request, it prints a message indicating that the request was not handled.
3. **Client Code**: The client creates instances of the handlers and sets up the chain. It then sends requests to the first handler in the chain (`lowLevel`). Each handler checks if it can handle the request; if not, it passes the request to the next handler.

### Benefits of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

- **Decoupling**: The sender of the request does not need to know which handler will process it.
- **Flexibility**: Handlers can be added or removed dynamically without affecting the client code.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each handler has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.

### Use Cases

- **Event Handling Systems**: Where events are passed through a chain of listeners.
- **Logging Frameworks**: Where log messages can be processed by different loggers based on severity.
- **Middleware in Web Applications**: Where requests can be processed by a series of filters.

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a powerful design pattern that promotes loose coupling and enhances the flexibility of your code.

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, allowing for more flexible and extensible code.

### Components of the Command Pattern

1. **Command Interface**: This defines a method for executing a command.
2. **Concrete Command**: This implements the Command interface and defines the binding between a receiver and an action.
3. **Receiver**: This is the object that performs the actual work when the command is executed.
4. **Invoker**: This is the object that holds and invokes the command.
5. **Client**: The client creates a command object and associates it with a receiver.

### Example in Java

Let's illustrate the Command Pattern with a simple example of a remote control system that can turn on and off a light.

#### Step 1: Define the Command Interface

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Receiver

```java
public class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("The light is ON");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("The light is OFF");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Concrete Commands

```java
public class TurnOnLightCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public TurnOnLightCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}

public class TurnOffLightCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public TurnOffLightCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOff();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create the Invoker

```java
public class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Client Code

```java
public class CommandPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the receiver
        Light light = new Light();

        // Create command objects
        Command turnOn = new TurnOnLightCommand(light);
        Command turnOff = new TurnOffLightCommand(light);

        // Create the invoker
        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();

        // Turn on the light
        remote.setCommand(turnOn);
        remote.pressButton();

        // Turn off the light
        remote.setCommand(turnOff);
        remote.pressButton();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Command Interface**: The `Command` interface defines the `execute` method that all concrete commands will implement.
2. **Receiver**: The `Light` class is the receiver that contains the actual logic for turning the light on and off.
3. **Concrete Commands**: 
   - `TurnOnLightCommand` encapsulates the action of turning the light on.
   - `TurnOffLightCommand` encapsulates the action of turning the light off.
4. **Invoker**: The `RemoteControl` class acts as the invoker that holds a command and invokes it when the button is pressed.
5. **Client Code**: The client creates instances of the receiver and commands, sets the command in the invoker, and invokes the command by pressing the button.

### Benefits of the Command Pattern

- **Decoupling**: The sender and receiver are decoupled, allowing for more flexible code.
- **Parameterization**: Commands can be parameterized and stored for later execution.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: The pattern can be extended to support undo/redo operations by maintaining a history of commands.
- **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without changing existing code.

### Use Cases

- **GUI Buttons**: Where button clicks can be mapped to commands.
- **Transaction Systems**: Where operations can be queued and executed later.
- **Macro Recording**: Where a series of commands can be recorded and executed as a single command.

The Command Pattern is a powerful design pattern that enhances the flexibility and maintainability of your code by encapsulating requests as objects.

The Iterator Pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object (like a collection) sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to traverse a collection without needing to know the details of how the collection is implemented.

### Key Components of the Iterator Pattern

1. **Iterator**: This is an interface that defines the methods for traversing the collection.
2. **Concrete Iterator**: This class implements the Iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.
3. **Aggregate**: This is an interface that defines a method for creating an iterator.
4. **Concrete Aggregate**: This class implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the Concrete Iterator.

### Example Implementation in Java

Here’s a simple example of the Iterator Pattern in Java using a collection of integers.

#### Step 1: Create the Iterator Interface

```java
public interface Iterator<T> {
    boolean hasNext();
    T next();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Aggregate Interface

```java
public interface Aggregate<T> {
    Iterator<T> createIterator();
}
```

#### Step 3: Create a Concrete Iterator

```java
import java.util.List;

public class IntegerIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
    private List<Integer> integers;
    private int position = 0;

    public IntegerIterator(List<Integer> integers) {
        this.integers = integers;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return position < integers.size();
    }

    @Override
    public Integer next() {
        return integers.get(position++);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create a Concrete Aggregate

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class IntegerCollection implements Aggregate<Integer> {
    private List<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void add(Integer integer) {
        integers.add(integer);
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Integer> createIterator() {
        return new IntegerIterator(integers);
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Using the Iterator

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntegerCollection collection = new IntegerCollection();
        collection.add(1);
        collection.add(2);
        collection.add(3);
        collection.add(4);
        collection.add(5);

        Iterator<Integer> iterator = collection.createIterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Iterator Interface**: Defines the methods `hasNext()` and `next()` for iterating over elements.
2. **Aggregate Interface**: Defines the method `createIterator()` to create an iterator for the collection.
3. **IntegerIterator**: Implements the `Iterator` interface and provides the logic to iterate over a list of integers.
4. **IntegerCollection**: Implements the `Aggregate` interface and holds a list of integers. It provides a method to add integers and creates an iterator for the collection.
5. **Main Class**: Demonstrates how to use the `IntegerCollection` and its iterator to print the integers.

### Benefits of the Iterator Pattern

- **Separation of Concerns**: The collection's internal structure is hidden from the client code.
- **Multiple Iterators**: You can have multiple iterators for the same collection, allowing for concurrent traversal.
- **Simplified Code**: The client code can work with the iterator interface without needing to know the details of the collection.

This pattern is widely used in Java, especially in the Java Collections Framework, where classes like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, etc., implement the `Iterable` interface, allowing you to use the enhanced for-loop for iteration.


The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to communicate with each other without knowing about each other's internal details. Instead of having direct references to each other, objects communicate through a mediator object. This pattern promotes loose coupling and helps to reduce the dependencies between objects.

### Key Components of the Mediator Pattern

1. **Mediator Interface**: This defines the interface for communication between the colleague objects.
2. **Concrete Mediator**: This implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between the colleague objects.
3. **Colleague Classes**: These are the classes that communicate with each other through the mediator.

### Example in Java

Let's create a simple example of a chat application where users can send messages to each other through a chat room (the mediator).

#### Step 1: Define the Mediator Interface

```java
public interface ChatMediator {
    void sendMessage(String message, User user);
    void addUser (User user);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Concrete Mediator

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private List<User> users;

    public ChatRoom() {
        this.users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, User user) {
        for (User  u : users) {
            // Message should not be sent to the user who sent it
            if (u != user) {
                u.receive(message);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void addUser (User user) {
        this.users.add(user);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Colleague Class

```java
public abstract class User {
    protected ChatMediator mediator;
    protected String name;

    public User(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void send(String message);
    public abstract void receive(String message);
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Colleague Classes

```java
public class ChatUser  extends User {

    public ChatUser (ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        super(mediator, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + ": Sending Message = " + message);
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receive(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + ": Received Message = " + message);
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Demonstrate the Mediator Pattern

```java
public class MediatorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatRoom = new ChatRoom();

        User user1 = new ChatUser (chatRoom, "Alice");
        User user2 = new ChatUser (chatRoom, "Bob");
        User user3 = new ChatUser (chatRoom, "Charlie");

        chatRoom.addUser (user1);
        chatRoom.addUser (user2);
        chatRoom.addUser (user3);

        user1.send("Hello, everyone!");
        user2.send("Hi, Alice!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **ChatMediator**: This interface defines the methods for sending messages and adding users.
2. **ChatRoom**: This class implements the `ChatMediator` interface and manages the list of users. It handles the logic for sending messages to all users except the sender.
3. **User **: This is an abstract class that defines the structure for user classes. It has methods for sending and receiving messages.
4. **ChatUser **: This class extends `User ` and implements the methods to send and receive messages.
5. **MediatorPatternDemo**: This is the main class that demonstrates the functionality of the Mediator Pattern by creating a chat room and users, and sending messages.

### Benefits of the Mediator Pattern

- **Loose Coupling**: Colleagues are not aware of each other, which reduces dependencies.
- **Centralized Control**: The mediator centralizes communication, making it easier to manage and modify interactions.
- **Scalability**: New colleague classes can be added without modifying existing code.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you have multiple objects that need to communicate in a complex way, such as GUI components, chat applications, or any system where you want to reduce direct dependencies between components.

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to capture its internal state and save it externally so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. This is particularly useful for implementing features like undo/redo functionality in applications.

### Components of the Memento Pattern

1. **Memento**: This class stores the internal state of the Originator object. It can only be accessed by the Originator and the Caretaker.
  
2. **Originator**: This class creates a Memento containing a snapshot of its current state and can use the Memento to restore its state.

3. **Caretaker**: This class is responsible for keeping track of the Memento. It does not modify or inspect the contents of the Memento.

### Example Implementation in Java

Here’s a simple example of the Memento Pattern in Java:

```java
// Memento class
class Memento {
    private final String state;

    public Memento(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}

// Originator class
class Originator {
    private String state;

    public void setState(String state) {
        System.out.println("Setting state to: " + state);
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public Memento saveStateToMemento() {
        return new Memento(state);
    }

    public void getStateFromMemento(Memento memento) {
        state = memento.getState();
        System.out.println("State restored to: " + state);
    }
}

// Caretaker class
class Caretaker {
    private final List<Memento> mementoList = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addMemento(Memento memento) {
        mementoList.add(memento);
    }

    public Memento getMemento(int index) {
        return mementoList.get(index);
    }
}

// Client code
public class MementoPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Originator originator = new Originator();
        Caretaker caretaker = new Caretaker();

        originator.setState("State #1");
        caretaker.addMemento(originator.saveStateToMemento());

        originator.setState("State #2");
        caretaker.addMemento(originator.saveStateToMemento());

        originator.setState("State #3");
        System.out.println("Current State: " + originator.getState());

        // Restore to previous state
        originator.getStateFromMemento(caretaker.getMemento(0));
        System.out.println("Current State after restoring: " + originator.getState());
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Memento Class**: This class holds the state of the `Originator`. It has a constructor to set the state and a method to retrieve it.

2. **Originator Class**: This class has a state and methods to set the state, save it to a Memento, and restore it from a Memento.

3. **Caretaker Class**: This class manages the Memento objects. It can add Mementos to a list and retrieve them by index.

4. **Client Code**: In the `MementoPatternDemo` class, we create an `Originator` and a `Caretaker`. We change the state of the `Originator`, save its state in the `Caretaker`, and then restore a previous state using the Memento.

### Use Cases

- Implementing undo/redo functionality in applications.
- Saving the state of an object before a significant change.
- Version control systems where you need to keep track of different states of a file.

### Conclusion

The Memento Pattern is a powerful way to manage state in an object-oriented design while maintaining encapsulation. It allows for easy state restoration and can be particularly useful in applications that require tracking changes over time.

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a change in one object requires updating others, such as in event handling systems, data binding in UI frameworks, and more.

### Components of the Observer Pattern

1. **Subject**: The object that holds the state and notifies observers about changes.
  
2. **Observer**: An interface or abstract class that defines the method(s) to be called when the subject's state changes.

3. **ConcreteSubject**: A concrete implementation of the Subject that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.

4. **ConcreteObserver**: A concrete implementation of the Observer that updates itself based on the state of the ConcreteSubject.

### Example Implementation in Java

Here’s a simple example of the Observer Pattern in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Observer interface
interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

// Subject interface
interface Subject {
    void attach(Observer observer);
    void detach(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

// ConcreteSubject class
class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    private final List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String state;

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    @Override
    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(state);
        }
    }
}

// ConcreteObserver class
class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private final String name;

    public ConcreteObserver(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received update: " + message);
    }
}

// Client code
public class ObserverPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcreteSubject subject = new ConcreteSubject();

        ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 1");
        ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 2");

        subject.attach(observer1);
        subject.attach(observer2);

        subject.setState("State #1");
        subject.setState("State #2");

        subject.detach(observer1);
        subject.setState("State #3");
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Observer Interface**: This interface defines the `update` method that will be called when the subject's state changes.

2. **Subject Interface**: This interface defines methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers.

3. **ConcreteSubject Class**: This class implements the Subject interface. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them when its state changes. The `setState` method changes the state and calls `notifyObservers`.

4. **ConcreteObserver Class**: This class implements the Observer interface. It has a name and implements the `update` method to receive updates from the subject.

5. **Client Code**: In the `ObserverPatternDemo` class, we create a `ConcreteSubject` and two `ConcreteObserver` instances. We attach the observers to the subject, change the state of the subject, and observe how the observers receive updates. We also demonstrate detaching an observer.

### Use Cases

- Event handling systems (e.g., GUI frameworks).
- Data binding in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectures.
- Implementing publish/subscribe mechanisms.

### Conclusion

The Observer Pattern is a powerful way to establish a loose coupling between objects, allowing for dynamic updates and notifications. It is widely used in various applications, especially in event-driven systems, making it a fundamental pattern in software design.

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to exhibit different behaviors based on its state, and it helps to avoid large conditional statements that can make the code difficult to maintain.

### Key Components of the State Pattern

1. **Context**: This is the class that has a state and can change its state.
2. **State Interface**: This defines the interface for the various states.
3. **Concrete States**: These are the classes that implement the State interface and define specific behaviors for each state.

### Example Implementation in Java

Let's consider a simple example of a `Context` class representing a `TrafficLight`, which can be in one of three states: `Red`, `Yellow`, or `Green`.

#### Step 1: Define the State Interface

```java
public interface TrafficLightState {
    void changeLight(TrafficLight context);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete States

```java
public class RedLight implements TrafficLightState {
    @Override
    public void changeLight(TrafficLight context) {
        System.out.println("Red Light: Stop!");
        context.setState(new GreenLight());
    }
}

public class YellowLight implements TrafficLightState {
    @Override
    public void changeLight(TrafficLight context) {
        System.out.println("Yellow Light: Get Ready to Stop!");
        context.setState(new RedLight());
    }
}

public class GreenLight implements TrafficLightState {
    @Override
    public void changeLight(TrafficLight context) {
        System.out.println("Green Light: Go!");
        context.setState(new YellowLight());
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Context Class

```java
public class TrafficLight {
    private TrafficLightState state;

    public TrafficLight() {
        // Initial state
        this.state = new RedLight();
    }

    public void setState(TrafficLightState state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void changeLight() {
        state.changeLight(this);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Using the State Pattern

Now, you can use the `TrafficLight` class to change its state:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrafficLight trafficLight = new TrafficLight();

        // Simulate changing lights
        trafficLight.changeLight(); // Red Light: Stop!
        trafficLight.changeLight(); // Green Light: Go!
        trafficLight.changeLight(); // Yellow Light: Get Ready to Stop!
        trafficLight.changeLight(); // Red Light: Stop!
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **TrafficLightState**: This interface defines the method `changeLight` that all concrete states must implement.
2. **Concrete States**: Each concrete state (`RedLight`, `YellowLight`, `GreenLight`) implements the `changeLight` method, defining the behavior for that state and transitioning to the next state.
3. **TrafficLight**: This class maintains a reference to the current state and delegates the state-specific behavior to the current state object.

### Benefits of the State Pattern

- **Encapsulation of State-Specific Behavior**: Each state is encapsulated in its own class, making the code easier to manage and extend.
- **Elimination of Conditional Statements**: The state transitions are handled by the state classes, reducing the need for complex conditional logic in the context class.
- **Flexibility**: New states can be added easily without modifying existing code.

### Conclusion

The State Pattern is a powerful design pattern that can help manage state transitions in an object-oriented way. By encapsulating state-specific behavior in separate classes, it promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

### Key Components of the Strategy Pattern

1. **Context**: This is the class that uses a `Strategy` to perform a specific task.
2. **Strategy Interface**: This defines a common interface for all concrete strategies.
3. **Concrete Strategies**: These are the classes that implement the `Strategy` interface and provide specific implementations of the algorithm.

### Example Implementation in Java

Let's consider a simple example of a `SortingContext` that can sort an array using different sorting strategies: Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.

#### Step 1: Define the Strategy Interface

```java
public interface SortingStrategy {
    void sort(int[] array);
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Strategies

```java
public class BubbleSort implements SortingStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        System.out.println("Sorting using Bubble Sort");
        int n = array.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
                    // swap array[j] and array[j+1]
                    int temp = array[j];
                    array[j] = array[j + 1];
                    array[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

public class QuickSort implements SortingStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] array) {
        System.out.println("Sorting using Quick Sort");
        quickSort(array, 0, array.length - 1);
    }

    private void quickSort(int[] array, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(array, low, high);
            quickSort(array, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(array, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(int[] array, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = array[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (array[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                // swap array[i] and array[j]
                int temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[j];
                array[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        // swap array[i + 1] and array[high] (or pivot)
        int temp = array[i + 1];
        array[i + 1] = array[high];
        array[high] = temp;
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Context Class

```java
public class SortingContext {
    private SortingStrategy strategy;

    public SortingContext(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void sort(int[] array) {
        strategy.sort(array);
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Using the Strategy Pattern

Now, you can use the `SortingContext` class to sort an array using different strategies:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};

        // Using Bubble Sort
        SortingContext context = new SortingContext(new BubbleSort());
        context.sort(array);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(array));

        // Resetting the array
        array = new int[]{5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};

        // Using Quick Sort
        context.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
        context.sort(array);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(array));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **SortingStrategy**: This interface defines the method `sort` that all concrete strategies must implement.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: Each concrete strategy (`BubbleSort`, `QuickSort`) implements the `sort` method, providing a specific sorting algorithm.
3. **SortingContext**: This class maintains a reference to the current strategy and delegates the sorting operation to the strategy object.

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern

- **Flexibility**: You can change the algorithm used by the context at runtime without modifying the context class.
- **Encapsulation**: Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class, making the code easier to manage and extend.
- **Elimination of Conditional Logic**: The strategy pattern eliminates the need for conditional statements to select the algorithm, leading to cleaner code

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is useful when you have a common algorithm that can be customized in certain ways by subclasses.

### Key Components of the Template Method Pattern

1. **Abstract Class**: This class defines the template method and contains the common algorithm structure. It may also define some abstract methods that subclasses must implement.
2. **Concrete Classes**: These classes extend the abstract class and provide specific implementations for the abstract methods.

### Example Implementation in Java

Let's consider a simple example of a `DataProcessor` that processes data in different ways: `CSV` and `XML`. The processing steps are the same, but the way data is read and written differs.

#### Step 1: Define the Abstract Class

```java
public abstract class DataProcessor {
    // Template method
    public final void processData() {
        readData();
        processData();
        writeData();
    }

    protected abstract void readData();
    protected abstract void processData();
    protected abstract void writeData();
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Classes

```java
public class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data from CSV file.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing CSV data.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data to CSV file.");
    }
}

public class XMLDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data from XML file.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing XML data.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data to XML file.");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Using the Template Method Pattern

Now, you can use the `DataProcessor` classes to process data in different formats:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor();
        csvProcessor.processData();

        System.out.println();

        DataProcessor xmlProcessor = new XMLDataProcessor();
        xmlProcessor.processData();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **DataProcessor**: This abstract class defines the template method `processData()`, which outlines the steps for processing data. It also declares abstract methods for reading, processing, and writing data that must be implemented by subclasses.
2. **Concrete Classes**: `CSVDataProcessor` and `XMLDataProcessor` extend the `DataProcessor` class and provide specific implementations for the abstract methods, defining how to read, process, and write data for each format.

### Benefits of the Template Method Pattern

- **Code Reusability**: The common algorithm is defined in the abstract class, promoting code reuse.
- **Flexibility**: Subclasses can customize specific steps of the algorithm without changing the overall structure.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The template method separates the algorithm's structure from its implementation, making it easier to manage and extend.

### Conclusion

The Template Method Pattern is a powerful design pattern that allows you to define a common algorithm structure while enabling subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps. This promotes code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability in your software design.

The Visitor Pattern is a design pattern that allows you to separate an algorithm from the objects on which it operates. This is particularly useful when you have a structure of objects with different types, and you want to perform operations on these objects without modifying their classes.

### Key Components of the Visitor Pattern

1. **Visitor Interface**: This defines a visit method for each type of element in the object structure.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: This implements the Visitor interface and provides the specific implementation of the visit methods.
3. **Element Interface**: This defines an `accept` method that takes a visitor as an argument.
4. **Concrete Elements**: These are the classes that implement the Element interface and define the `accept` method to call the appropriate visit method on the visitor.

### Example in Java

Let's illustrate the Visitor Pattern with a simple example involving shapes: `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

#### Step 1: Define the Visitor Interface

```java
interface ShapeVisitor {
    void visit(Circle circle);
    void visit(Rectangle rectangle);
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the Element Interface

```java
interface Shape {
    void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor);
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Concrete Elements

```java
class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
    
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void accept(ShapeVisitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
    
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle");
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create a Concrete Visitor

```java
class ShapeDrawVisitor implements ShapeVisitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(Circle circle) {
        circle.draw();
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(Rectangle rectangle) {
        rectangle.draw();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Using the Visitor Pattern

Now, you can use the Visitor Pattern to operate on different shapes without modifying their classes.

```java
public class VisitorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();
        
        ShapeVisitor drawVisitor = new ShapeDrawVisitor();
        
        circle.accept(drawVisitor);   // Output: Drawing a Circle
        rectangle.accept(drawVisitor); // Output: Drawing a Rectangle
    }
}
```

### Advantages of the Visitor Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The algorithm is separated from the object structure, making it easier to manage and extend.
2. **Adding New Operations**: You can add new operations without changing the existing classes.
3. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single responsibility, either to represent data or to perform operations on that data.

### Disadvantages of the Visitor Pattern

1. **Tight Coupling**: The Visitor pattern can lead to tight coupling between the visitor and the elements, as the visitor needs to know about all the concrete element classes.
2. **Difficult to Add New Elements**: Adding new elements requires modifying the visitor interface and all concrete visitors, which can be cumbersome.

### Conclusion

The Visitor Pattern is a powerful design pattern that can help you manage complex object structures and operations on them. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform multiple unrelated operations on a set of objects. However, it is essential to weigh its advantages against its disadvantages before implementing it in your design.



Answering a Low-Level Design (LLD) interview problem effectively requires a structured approach. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate through the process:

### 1. Understand the Problem

- **Clarify Requirements**: Start by asking clarifying questions to ensure you understand the problem statement. What are the key functionalities? Are there any constraints or specific requirements?
- **Identify Use Cases**: Discuss the primary use cases and scenarios that the system should handle.

### 2. Define the Scope

- **Limit the Scope**: Determine what features you will implement in your design. It’s better to have a well-defined subset of features than to try to cover everything superficially.
- **Identify Key Components**: Break down the system into major components or modules.

### 3. Choose the Right Design Patterns

- **Select Appropriate Patterns**: Based on the requirements, think about which design patterns might be applicable (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Visitor, etc.).
- **Justify Your Choices**: Be prepared to explain why you chose a particular pattern and how it fits the problem.

### 4. Create Class Diagrams

- **Draw Class Diagrams**: Use UML diagrams to represent the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (inheritance, composition, etc.).
- **Define Interfaces**: Clearly define interfaces for your components to promote loose coupling.

### 5. Define Relationships

- **Composition vs. Inheritance**: Decide when to use composition over inheritance and vice versa. Favor composition for flexibility.
- **Aggregation**: Identify how different classes will interact with each other.

### 6. Write Pseudocode or Code Snippets

- **Implement Key Methods**: Write pseudocode or actual code snippets for the core functionalities. Focus on the most critical parts of the system.
- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid over-engineering. Write clean, understandable code.

### 7. Discuss Scalability and Extensibility

- **Scalability**: Discuss how your design can handle increased load or data. Consider aspects like load balancing, caching, etc.
- **Extensibility**: Explain how easy it would be to add new features or modify existing ones without significant changes to the codebase.

### 8. Consider Edge Cases

- **Identify Edge Cases**: Discuss potential edge cases and how your design handles them. This shows that you have thought through the problem thoroughly.
- **Error Handling**: Explain how your system will handle errors and exceptions.

### 9. Review and Iterate

- **Walk Through Your Design**: Present your design step-by-step, explaining your thought process and decisions.
- **Be Open to Feedback**: Be prepared to receive questions or suggestions from the interviewer. Engage in a discussion and iterate on your design based on their feedback.

### 10. Practice Common LLD Problems

Familiarize yourself with common LLD interview problems, such as:

- Design a parking lot system.
- Design a library management system.
- Design an online shopping cart.
- Design a URL shortening service.
- Design a social media feed.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s say you are asked to design a **Library Management System**. Here’s how you might approach it:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Ask about user roles (librarians, members), functionalities (borrow, return, search books), and constraints (overdue fines, book availability).
  
2. **Define Scope**: Decide to implement basic functionalities like adding books, borrowing, and returning.

3. **Choose Patterns**: You might use the Singleton pattern for the library instance and the Factory pattern for creating different types of users.

4. **Class Diagram**: Draw classes like `Library`, `Book`, `User `, `Member`, and `Librarian`, showing their relationships.

5. **Write Pseudocode**: Implement methods like `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, and `searchBook()`.

6. **Discuss Scalability**: Talk about how you could implement a database for persistent storage and caching for frequently accessed books.

7. **Edge Cases**: Discuss what happens if a member tries to borrow a book that is already checked out.

8. **Review**: Walk through your design, explaining each component and how they interact.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively communicate your design thinking and problem-solving skills during an LLD interview.

### Java Implementation

Here’s a simple implementation of the above design:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Enum for Vehicle Types
enum VehicleType {
    CAR, MOTORCYCLE, TRUCK
}

// Vehicle Class
class Vehicle {
    private String licensePlate;
    private VehicleType type;

    public Vehicle(String licensePlate, VehicleType type) {
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
        this.type = type;
    }

    public String getLicensePlate() {
        return licensePlate;
    }

    public VehicleType getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

// ParkingSpot Class
class ParkingSpot {
    private int spotNumber;
    private boolean isOccupied;
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    public ParkingSpot(int spotNumber) {
        this.spotNumber = spotNumber;
        this.isOccupied = false;
    }

    public boolean park(Vehicle vehicle) {
        if (!isOccupied) {
            this.vehicle = vehicle;
            isOccupied = true;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public Vehicle remove() {
        Vehicle temp = vehicle;
        vehicle = null;
        isOccupied = false;
        return temp;
    }

    public boolean isOccupied() {
        return isOccupied;
    }

    public int getSpotNumber() {
        return spotNumber;
    }
}

// ParkingLot Class
class ParkingLot {
    private List<ParkingSpot> parkingSpots;
    private int totalSpots;
    private int availableSpots;

    public ParkingLot(int totalSpots) {
        this.totalSpots = totalSpots;
        this.availableSpots = totalSpots;
        parkingSpots = new ArrayList<>(totalSpots);
        for (int i = 0; i < totalSpots; i++) {
            parkingSpots.add(new ParkingSpot(i + 1));
        }
    }

    public boolean parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        for (ParkingSpot spot : parkingSpots) {
            if (!spot.isOccupied() && canFitVehicle(vehicle)) {
                return spot.park(vehicle);
            }
        }
        return false; // No available spot
    }

    public Vehicle removeVehicle(String licensePlate) {
        for (ParkingSpot spot : parkingSpots) {
            if (spot.isOccupied() && spot.remove().getLicensePlate().equals(licensePlate)) {
                return spot.remove();
            }
        }
        return null; // Vehicle not found
    }

    public int getAvailableSpots() {
        return availableSpots;
    }

    private boolean canFitVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        // Logic to check if the vehicle can fit in the parking lot
        // For simplicity, we assume all vehicles can fit in any spot
        return true;
    }
}

// Main Class to Test the Parking Lot
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ParkingLot parkingLot = new ParkingLot(10);
        
        Vehicle car1 = new Vehicle("ABC123", VehicleType.CAR);
        Vehicle bike1 = new Vehicle("XYZ789", VehicleType.MOTORCYCLE);
        
        System.out.println("Parking Car: " + parkingLot.parkVehicle(car1)); // Should return true
        System.out.println("Parking Bike: " + parkingLot.parkVehicle(bike1)); // Should return true
        System.out.println("Available Spots: " + parkingLot.getAvailableSpots()); // Should return 8
        
        parkingLot.removeVehicle("ABC123");
        System.out.println("Available Spots after removing Car: " + parkingLot.getAvailableSpots()); // Should return 9
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Vehicle Class**: Represents a vehicle with a license plate and type.
2 . **ParkingSpot Class**: Represents a parking spot that can either be occupied or free. It has methods to park a vehicle and remove it.
3. **ParkingLot Class**: Manages the collection of parking spots, allowing vehicles to be parked and removed. It keeps track of the total and available spots.
4. **Main Class**: Contains the main method to test the functionality of the parking lot system by creating instances of vehicles and parking them in the lot.

### Enhancements

To further improve the design, consider adding the following features:

- **Different Vehicle Sizes**: Modify the `Vehicle` class to include size attributes and adjust the `canFitVehicle` method accordingly.
- **Parking Fee Calculation**: Implement a fee structure based on the duration of parking.
- **Reservation System**: Allow users to reserve parking spots in advance.
- **User  Interface**: Create a simple command-line or graphical user interface for better interaction.

This design provides a solid foundation for a parking lot management system, and the enhancements can be implemented as needed to meet specific requirements.

        }
    }
}

class VendingMachine {
    private List<Item> items;
    private double balance;

    public VendingMachine() {
        this.items = new ArrayList<>();
        this.balance = 0.0;
    }

    public void addItem(Item item) {
        items.add(item);
    }

    public void removeItem(String itemCode) {
        items.removeIf(item -> item.getCode().equals(itemCode));
    }

    public void insertMoney(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public Item selectItem(String itemCode) {
        for (Item item : items) {
            if (item.getCode().equals(itemCode) && item.isAvailable()) {
                if (balance >= item.getPrice()) {
                    balance -= item.getPrice();
                    item.dispense();
                    return item;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Insufficient balance.");
                    return null;
                }

        }
        System.out.println("Item not available.");
        return null;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void refund() {
        System.out.println("Refunding: " + balance);

        Item selectedItem = vendingMachine.selectItem("A1");
        if (selectedItem != null) {
            ui.displayMessage("Dispensing: " + selectedItem.getName());
        }

        ui.displayBalance(vendingMachine.getBalance());
        vendingMachine.refund();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Item Class**: Represents an item in the vending machine with attributes for the code, name, price, and quantity. It has methods to check availability and dispense the item.

2. **VendingMachine Class**: Manages the collection of items and the user's balance. It allows adding and removing items, inserting money, selecting items, and processing refunds.

3. **User Interface Class**: Handles the display of items, balance, and messages to the user, providing a simple way to interact with the vending machine.

4. **VendingMachineApp Class**: The main application class that initializes the vending machine, adds items, and simulates user interactions such as inserting money, selecting an item, and requesting a refund.

This design provides a clear structure for the vending machine's functionality, allowing for easy modifications and enhancements in the future, such as adding more features like inventory management or payment processing.

To design a logging framework in Java, focus on key features such as supporting multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL), and enabling logging to various outputs like console, files, and databases. Utilize object-oriented principles and design patterns to ensure scalability and maintainability. 

**Key Components of the Logging Framework**

- **Log Levels**: Define different categories of logs.
  - DEBUG
  - INFO
  - WARN
  - ERROR
  - FATAL

- **Output Destinations**: Support multiple logging outputs.
  - Console
  - File
  - Database

- **Configurability**: Allow dynamic configuration of log levels and output destinations.

---

**Design Patterns Used**

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the logger throughout the application to avoid data inconsistency.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows log messages to be processed through a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the message or pass it to the next handler.

- **Observer Pattern**: Enables multiple observers (loggers) to react to log messages, allowing for broadcasting to various destinations.

---

**Class Structure**

1. **LogLevel Enum**: Represents different log levels.
   ```java
   public enum LogLevel {
       DEBUG(1), INFO(2), WARN(3), ERROR(4), FATAL(5);
       
       private final int level;
       
       LogLevel(int value) {
           this.level = value;
       }
       
       public int getLevel() {
           return level;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Logger Class**: Main class for logging messages.
   ```java
   public class Logger {
       private static final Logger instance = new Logger();
       private LoggerHandler loggerHandler;
       
       private Logger() {
           loggerHandler = LogManager.buildLoggerChain();
       }
       
       public static Logger getInstance() {
           return instance;
       }
       
       public void log(String message, LogLevel level) {
           loggerHandler.log(level, message);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **LoggerHandler Abstract Class**: Base class for different loggers.
   ```java
   public abstract class LoggerHandler {
       protected LoggerHandler nextHandler;
       protected LogLevel level;
       
       public void setNextHandler(LoggerHandler nextHandler) {
           this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
       }
       
       public void log(LogLevel level, String message) {
           if (this.level.getLevel() <= level.getLevel()) {
               writeMessage(message);
           }
           if (nextHandler != null) {
               nextHandler.log(level, message);
           }
       }
       
       protected abstract void writeMessage(String message);
   }
   ```

4. **Concrete Logger Classes**: Implement specific logging behaviors.
   ```java
   public class ConsoleLogger extends LoggerHandler {
       public ConsoleLogger(LogLevel level) {
           this.level = level;
       }
       
       @Override
       protected void writeMessage(String message) {
           System.out.println("Console: " + message);
       }
   }
   
   public class FileLogger extends LoggerHandler {
       public FileLogger(LogLevel level) {
           this.level = level;
       }
       
       @Override
       protected void writeMessage(String message) {
           // Code to write to a file
           System.out.println("File: " + message);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **LogManager Class**: Manages the logger chain.
   ```java
   public class LogManager {
       public static LoggerHandler buildLoggerChain() {
           LoggerHandler consoleLogger = new ConsoleLogger(LogLevel.INFO);
           LoggerHandler fileLogger = new FileLogger(LogLevel.ERROR);
           
           consoleLogger.setNextHandler(fileLogger);
           return consoleLogger;
       }
   }
   ```

---

**Usage Example**

```java
public class LoggingExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();
       logger.log("This is an info message", LogLevel.INFO);
       logger.log("This is an error message", LogLevel.ERROR);
   }
}

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Scanner;

class Coffee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double price;

    public Coffee(int id, String name, double price) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    public boolean processPayment(double amount) {
        // Simulate payment processing
        System.out.println("Processing payment of: $" + amount);
        return true; // Assume payment is always successful for simplicity
    }
}

class ChangeDispenser {
    public void dispenseChange(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Dispensing change: $" + amount);
    }
}

class CoffeeVendingMachine {
    private List<Coffee> coffeeMenu;
    private double balance;
    private PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;
    private ChangeDispenser changeDispenser;

    public CoffeeVendingMachine() {
        coffeeMenu = new ArrayList<>();
        paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
        changeDispenser = new ChangeDispenser();
        initializeMenu();
    }

    private void initializeMenu() {
        coffeeMenu.add(new Coffee(1, "Espresso", 2.50));
        coffeeMenu.add(new Coffee(2, "Latte", 3.00));
        coffeeMenu.add(new Coffee(3, "Cappuccino", 3.50));
    }

    public void displayMenu() {
        System.out.println("Coffee Menu:");
        for (Coffee coffee : coffeeMenu) {
            System.out.println(coffee.getId() + ". " + coffee.getName() + " - $" + coffee.getPrice());
        }
    }

    public void selectCoffee(int coffeeId) {
        for (Coffee coffee : coffeeMenu) {
            if (coffee.getId() == coffeeId) {
                System.out.println("You selected: " + coffee.getName());
                balance = coffee.getPrice();
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Invalid selection.");
    }

    public void insertMoney(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Inserted: $" + amount);
        if (paymentProcessor.processPayment(amount)) {
            if (amount >= balance) {
                dispenseCoffee();
                if (amount > balance) {
                    returnChange(amount - balance);
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("Insufficient funds. Please insert more money.");
            }
        }
    }

    public void dispenseCoffee() {
        System.out.println("Dispensing coffee...");
        balance = 0; // Reset balance after dispensing
    }

    public void returnChange(double amount) {
        changeDispenser.dispenseChange(amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CoffeeVendingMachine vendingMachine = new CoffeeVendingMachine();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (true) {
            vendingMachine.displayMenu();
            System.out.print("Select coffee by ID (or 0 to exit): ");
            int coffeeId = scanner.nextInt();
            if (coffeeId == 0) {
                break;
            }
            vendingMachine.selectCoffee(coffeeId);
            System.out.print("Insert money: $");
            double amount = scanner.nextDouble();
            vendingMachine.insertMoney(amount);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Coffee Class**: Represents a coffee item with an ID, name, and price.
2. **PaymentProcessor Class**: Simulates payment processing.
3. **ChangeDispenser Class**: Handles the dispensing of change.
4. **CoffeeVendingMachine Class**: Manages the coffee vending machine's operations, including displaying the menu, selecting coffee, processing payments, and dispensing coffee and change.

### Enhancements

To improve the functionality and user experience, consider adding the following features:

- **Inventory Management**: Track the quantity of each coffee type and prevent selection if the item is out of stock.
- **User  Interface**: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better interaction.
- **Logging**: Add logging for transactions to keep track of sales and user interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected inputs or system failures.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support various payment methods such as credit cards, mobile payments, etc.

### Example of Inventory Management

To implement inventory management, you can modify the `Coffee` class to include a quantity attribute and update the `selectCoffee` method in the `CoffeeVendingMachine` class to check for stock availability.

```java
class Coffee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int quantity; // New attribute for inventory

    public Coffee(int id, String name, double price, int quantity) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    public void reduceQuantity() {
        if (quantity > 0) {
            quantity--;
        }
    }
}

class CoffeeVendingMachine {
    // Existing attributes...

    private void initializeMenu() {
        coffeeMenu.add(new Coffee(1, "Espresso", 2.50, 10));
        coffeeMenu.add(new Coffee(2, "Latte", 3.00, 5));
        coffeeMenu.add(new Coffee(3, "Cappuccino", 3.50, 0)); // Out of stock
    }

    public void selectCoffee(int coffeeId) {
        for (Coffee coffee : coffeeMenu) {
            if (coffee.getId() == coffeeId) {
                if (coffee.getQuantity() > 0) {
                    System.out.println("You selected: " + coffee.getName());
                    balance = coffee.getPrice();
                    coffee.reduceQuantity(); // Reduce inventory
                    return;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Sorry, " + coffee.getName() + " is out of stock.");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Invalid selection.");
    }
}
```

This enhancement ensures that the vending machine can manage its inventory effectively, providing a better experience for users. ### Additional Features

To further enhance the coffee vending machine, consider implementing the following features:

- **User  Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and log in, enabling personalized experiences and tracking purchase history.
- **Loyalty Program**: Introduce a loyalty program where users can earn points for each purchase, redeemable for discounts or free items.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Implement a system to notify operators when the machine requires maintenance or when stock levels are low.
- **Customizable Coffee Options**: Allow users to customize their coffee orders, such as adding flavors or adjusting sugar levels.

### Example of User Authentication

To implement user authentication, you can create a `User ` class and a simple login mechanism.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }
}

class UserManager {
    private HashMap<String, User> users;

    public UserManager() {
        users = new HashMap<>();
        // Add a sample user
        users.put("user1", new User("user1", "password123"));
    }

    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        User user = users.get(username);
        return user != null && user.getPassword().equals(password);
    }
}
```

### Modifying the Main Class for User Login

You can modify the `Main` class to include a login prompt before accessing the vending machine.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserManager userManager = new UserManager();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter username: ");
        String username = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Enter password: ");
        String password = scanner.nextLine();

        if (userManager.authenticate(username, password)) {
            CoffeeVendingMachine vendingMachine = new CoffeeVendingMachine();
            while (true) {
                vendingMachine.displayMenu();
                System.out.print("Select coffee by ID (or 0 to exit): ");
                int coffeeId = scanner.nextInt();
                if (coffeeId == 0) {
                    break;
                }
                vendingMachine.selectCoffee(coffeeId);
                System.out.print("Insert money: $");
                double amount = scanner.nextDouble();
                vendingMachine.insertMoney(amount);
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid username or password.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

This design provides a comprehensive framework for a coffee vending machine, incorporating essential functionalities and potential enhancements. By implementing features like user authentication and inventory management, the system can offer a more engaging and efficient experience for users while ensuring smooth operations for the vending machine.

Designing a Traffic Signal Control System involves creating a system that can manage the traffic lights at an intersection based on various conditions such as time, traffic density, and pedestrian requests.

### Implementation

Here is a basic implementation of the above classes:

```java
// Enum for SignalState
enum SignalState {
    GREEN, YELLOW, RED
}

// Class representing a Traffic Signal
class TrafficSignal {
    private SignalState state;
    private int greenDuration;
    private int yellowDuration;
    private int redDuration;

    public TrafficSignal(int greenDuration, int yellowDuration, int redDuration) {
        this.greenDuration = greenDuration;
        this.yellowDuration = yellowDuration;
        this.redDuration = redDuration;
        this.state = SignalState.RED; // Initial state
    }

    public void changeState(SignalState newState) {
        this.state = newState;
        System.out.println("Signal changed to: " + state);
    }

    public void startCycle() {
        changeState(SignalState.GREEN);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(greenDuration * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        changeState(SignalState.YELLOW);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(yellowDuration * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        changeState(SignalState.RED);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(redDuration * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public SignalState getState() {
        return state;
    }
}

// Class to control multiple Traffic Signals
class TrafficController {
    private TrafficSignal[] signals;
    private int currentSignalIndex;

    public TrafficController(TrafficSignal[] signals) {
        this.signals = signals;
        this.currentSignalIndex = 0;
    }

    public void cycleSignals() {
        while (true) {
            signals[currentSignalIndex].startCycle();
            currentSignalIndex = (currentSignalIndex + 1) % signals.length;
        }
    }

    public void requestPedestrianCrossing(int signalIndex) {
        if (signalIndex < signals.length) {
            System.out.println("Pedestrian crossing requested at signal: " + signalIndex);
            // Logic to handle pedestrian crossing can be added here
        }
    }
}

// Main class to simulate the Traffic Light System
public class TrafficLightSimulation {
    private TrafficController controller;

    public TrafficLightSimulation(TrafficController controller) {
        this.controller = controller;
    }

    public void startSimulation() {
        new Thread(() -> controller.cycleSignals()).start();
    }

    public void stopSimulation() {
        // Logic to stop the simulation can be added here
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrafficSignal signal1 = new TrafficSignal(10, 3, 7);
        TrafficSignal signal2 = new TrafficSignal(10, 3, 7);
        TrafficSignal[] signals = {signal1, signal2};

        TrafficController controller = new TrafficController(signals);
        TrafficLightSimulation simulation = new TrafficLightSimulation(controller);
        simulation.startSimulation();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **TrafficSignal Class**: This class represents a single traffic signal. It has methods to change its state and to start its cycle, which includes waiting for the specified durations for each state.

2. **TrafficController Class**: This class manages multiple traffic signals. It cycles through the signals, calling the `startCycle` method on each signal in turn.

3. **PedestrianRequest Class** : This class handles pedestrian crossing requests. It can mark a request as active or clear it.

4. **TrafficLightSimulation Class**: This class is responsible for starting and stopping the traffic light simulation. It creates a new thread to run the signal cycling in the background.

### Enhancements

To improve the Traffic Signal Control System, consider implementing the following features:

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Integrate sensors to monitor traffic density and adjust signal timings dynamically.
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Implement a mechanism to detect emergency vehicles and change the signal state to allow them to pass.
- **User  Interface**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the traffic signals and pedestrian requests.
- **Logging and Analytics**: Add logging capabilities to track signal changes and pedestrian requests for analysis and optimization.

### Conclusion

This low-level design provides a foundational structure for a Traffic Signal Control System in Java. The implementation can be expanded with additional features and optimizations to create a more robust and efficient system.

Designing a Task Management System involves creating a set of classes and interfaces that can handle tasks, users, and possibly projects. Below is a low-level design in Java that outlines the core components of such a system.

### Core Components

1. **Task**: Represents a task with attributes like ID, title, description, status, and due date.
2. **User **: Represents a user who can create and manage tasks.
3. **TaskManager**: Manages the tasks and users, providing methods to add, update, delete, and retrieve tasks.
4. **TaskStatus**: An enum to represent the status of a task (e.g., TO_DO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE).
5. **TaskRepository**: An interface for data persistence (could be implemented with a database or in-memory storage).

### Class Definitions

        return taskRepository.getAllTasks();
    }
}
```

### Example Usage

```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TaskRepository taskRepository = new InMemoryTaskRepository();
        TaskManager taskManager = new TaskManager (taskRepository);

        // Create a new task
        taskManager.createTask("1", "Design Database", "Design the database schema for the application", TaskStatus.TO_DO, LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(7));

        // Retrieve and update the task
        Task task = taskManager.getTask("1");
        task.setStatus(TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
        taskManager.updateTask(task);

        // List all tasks
        List<Task> tasks = taskManager.getAllTasks();
        for (Task t : tasks) {
            System.out.println("Task ID: " + t.getId() + ", Title: " + t.getTitle() + ", Status: " + t.getStatus());
        }

        // Delete the task
        taskManager.deleteTask("1");
    }
} ### Additional Features

To enhance the Task Management System, consider implementing the following features:

1. **Priority Levels**: Introduce a priority level for tasks (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
2. **Due Date Notifications**: Implement a notification system to alert users of upcoming due dates.
3. **User  Authentication**: Add user authentication to manage user sessions and secure task data.
4. **Task Assignment**: Allow tasks to be assigned to specific users.
5. **Search Functionality**: Implement search capabilities to find tasks based on title, status, or due date.

### Updated Class Definitions

```java
public enum TaskPriority {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
}

public class Task {
    private String id;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private TaskStatus status;
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;
    private TaskPriority priority;

    public Task(String id, String title, String description, TaskStatus status, LocalDateTime dueDate, TaskPriority priority) {
        this.id = id;
        this.title = title;
        this.description = description;
        this.status = status;
        this.dueDate = dueDate;
        this.priority = priority;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public TaskPriority getPriority() { return priority; }
    public void setPriority(TaskPriority priority) { this.priority = priority; }
}
```

#### 2. Updated TaskManager Class

```java
public class TaskManager {
    private TaskRepository taskRepository;

    public TaskManager(TaskRepository taskRepository) {
        this.taskRepository = taskRepository;
    }

    public void createTask(String id, String title, String description, TaskStatus status, LocalDateTime dueDate, TaskPriority priority) {
        Task task = new Task(id, title, description, status, dueDate, priority);
        taskRepository.addTask(task);
    }

    // Other methods remain unchanged
}
```

### Example Usage with Priority

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TaskRepository taskRepository = new InMemoryTaskRepository();
        TaskManager taskManager = new TaskManager(taskRepository);

        // Create a new task with priority
        taskManager.createTask("1", "Design Database", "Design the database schema for the application", TaskStatus.TO_DO, LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(7), TaskPriority.HIGH);

        // Retrieve and update the task
        Task task = taskManager.getTask("1");
        task.setStatus(TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS);
        taskManager.updateTask(task);

        // List all tasks
        List<Task> tasks = taskManager.getAllTasks();
        for (Task t : tasks) {
            System.out.println("Task ID: " + t.getId() + ", Title: " + t.getTitle() + ", Status: " + t.getStatus() + ", Priority: " + t.getPriority());
        }

        // Delete the task
        taskManager.deleteTask("1");
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

This design provides a solid foundation for a Task Management System. You can further expand it by integrating a database for persistent storage, implementing user authentication, and enhancing the user interface for better user experience.


Designing a Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) system involves creating a mechanism where publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive messages from that topic. Below is a low-level design of a simple Pub-Sub system in Java.

### Components of the Pub-Sub System

1. **Publisher**: Sends messages to a topic.
2. **Subscriber**: Receives messages from a topic.
3. **Message**: Represents the data being sent.
4. **Topic**: A named channel to which messages are sent and from which subscribers receive messages.
5. **Broker**: Manages the topics, publishers, and subscribers.

### Class Design

Here’s a simple class design for the Pub-Sub system:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

// Message class
class Message {
    private String content;

    public Message(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}

// Subscriber interface
interface Subscriber {
    void receive(Message message);
}

// Topic class
class Topic {
    private String name;
    private List<Subscriber> subscribers;

    public Topic(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.subscribers = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void subscribe(Subscriber subscriber) {
        subscribers.add(subscriber);
    }

    public void unsubscribe(Subscriber subscriber) {
        subscribers.remove(subscriber);
    }

    public void publish(Message message) {
        for (Subscriber subscriber : subscribers) {
            subscriber.receive(message);
        }
    }
}

// Broker class
class Broker {
    private Map<String, Topic> topics;

    public Broker() {
        this.topics = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void createTopic(String topicName) {
        topics.put(topicName, new Topic(topicName));
    }

    public Topic getTopic(String topicName) {
        return topics.get(topicName);
    }

    public void publish(String topicName, Message message) {
        Topic topic = getTopic(topicName);
        if (topic != null) {
            topic.publish(message);
        }
    }
}

// Example Subscriber implementation
class ConcreteSubscriber implements Subscriber {
    private String name;

    public ConcreteSubscriber(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void receive(Message message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message.getContent());
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate the Pub-Sub system
public class PubSubSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Broker broker = new Broker();

        // Create topics
        broker.createTopic("news");
        broker.createTopic("sports");

        // Create subscribers
        ConcreteSubscriber subscriber1 = new ConcreteSubscriber("Subscriber 1");
        ConcreteSubscriber subscriber2 = new ConcreteSubscriber("Subscriber 2");

        // Subscribe to topics
        broker.getTopic("news").subscribe(subscriber1);
        broker.getTopic("sports").subscribe(subscriber2);
        broker.getTopic("news").subscribe(subscriber2);

        // Publish messages
        broker.publish("news", new Message("Breaking News: New Pub-Sub system implemented!"));
        broker.publish("sports", new Message("Sports Update: Local team wins championship!"));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Message Class**: Represents the message being sent. It contains a single field for the message content.

2. **Subscriber Interface**: Defines a method `receive` that will be implemented by concrete subscribers to handle incoming messages.

3. **Topic Class**: Manages subscribers and handles message publishing. It maintains a list of subscribers and notifies them when a message is published.

4. **Broker Class**: Acts as the central point for managing topics. It allows creating topics, retrieving them, and publishing messages to them.

5. **ConcreteSubscriber Class**: An example implementation of the `Subscriber` interface that prints received messages to the console.

6. **Main Class**: Demonstrates the functionality of the Pub-Sub system by creating topics, subscribers, and publishing messages.

### Enhancements and Considerations

- **Thread Safety**: In a real-world application, you would need to consider thread safety, especially when dealing with multiple publishers and subscribers.
- **Persistence**: You might want to add persistence to store messages and subscriber states.
- **Message Filtering**: Implement filtering mechanisms to allow subscribers to receive only specific messages.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for various scenarios, such as publishing to a non-existent topic.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Consider using asynchronous processing for message delivery to improve performance.

This design provides a basic structure for a Pub-Sub system in Java, which can be expanded and enhanced based on specific requirements.

     - `String name` - The name of the player.
     - `char symbol` - The symbol of the player ('X' or 'O').
   - **Methods:**
     - `String getName()` - Returns the player's name.
     - `char getSymbol()` - Returns the player's symbol.

### Implementation

Here is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class TicTacToe {
    private char[][] board;
    private char currentPlayer;

    public TicTacToe() {
        board = new char[3][3];
        currentPlayer = 'X'; // X always starts first
        initializeBoard();
    }

    public void initializeBoard() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                board[i][j] = '-'; // Empty cell
            }
        }
    }

    public void printBoard() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                System.out.print(board[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    public boolean makeMove(int row, int col) {
        if (row >= 0 && row < 3 && col >= 0 && col < 3 && board[row][col] == '-') {
            board[row][col] = currentPlayer;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean checkWin() {
        // Check rows, columns, and diagonals
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if ((board[i][0] == currentPlayer && board[i][1] == currentPlayer && board[i][2] == currentPlayer) ||
                (board[0][i] == currentPlayer && board[1][i] == currentPlayer && board[2][i] == currentPlayer)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return (board[0][0] == currentPlayer && board[1][1] == currentPlayer && board[2][2] == currentPlayer) ||
               (board[0][2] == currentPlayer && board[1][1] == currentPlayer && board[2][0] == currentPlayer);
    }

    public boolean checkDraw() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '-') {
                    return false; // There is still an empty cell
                }
            }
        }
        return true; // No empty cells left
    }

    public void switchPlayer() {
        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 'X') ? 'O' : 'X';
    }

    public void playGame() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        while (true) {
            printBoard();
            System.out.println("Current player: " + currentPlayer);
            System.out.print("Enter row (0, 1, 2) and column (0, 1, 2): ");
            int row = scanner.nextInt();
            int col = scanner.nextInt();

            if (makeMove(row, col)) {
                if (checkWin()) {
                    printBoard();
                    System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer + " wins!");
                    break;
                }
                if (checkDraw()) {
                    printBoard();
                    System.out.println("The game is a draw!");
                    break;
                }
                switchPlayer();
            } else {
                System.out.println("This move is not valid. Try again.");
            }
        }
        scanner .close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();
        game.playGame();
    }
} 

```

The implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java is structured to allow two players to take turns making moves until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, and the players are identified by their symbols, 'X' and 'O'. The game logic includes methods for initializing the board, printing the current state, making moves, checking for wins or draws, and switching players. The main method creates an instance of the game and starts the gameplay loop, allowing user input for moves and providing feedback on the game status after each turn. The game is designed to be user-friendly, guiding players through their turns and providing clear feedback on the game state. The `playGame` method serves as the main loop, continuously prompting players for their moves until a win or draw condition is met. 

To enhance the user experience, additional features could be implemented, such as:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that the input is valid (e.g., integers within the correct range) and handle exceptions gracefully.
- **Replay Option**: After a game concludes, prompt players to start a new game without restarting the application.
- **Score Tracking**: Maintain a score for each player across multiple games.
- **AI Opponent**: Implement a simple AI to allow a single player to play against the computer.

These enhancements would make the game more engaging and versatile, catering to different player preferences and skill levels.

        this.date = date;
        this.attendees = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // Getters and Setters

    public void addAttendee(User user) {
        attendees.add(user);
    }

    public void removeAttendee(User user) {
        attendees.remove(user);
    }
}
```

#### Notification Class
```java
public class Notification {
    private String notificationId;
    private User recipient;
    private String message;
 private Date createdAt;

    public Notification(String notificationId, User recipient, String message) {
        this.notificationId = notificationId;
        this.recipient = recipient;
        this.message = message;
        this.createdAt = new Date();
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

### 3. **Relationships Between Classes**
- **User ** has a one-to-many relationship with **Post**, **Comment**, **FriendRequest**, **Message**, **Group**, and **Notification**.
- **Post** has a one-to-many relationship with **Comment**.
- **Group** has a many-to-many relationship with **User **.
- **Event** has a many-to-many relationship with **User **.

### 4. **Additional Considerations**
- Implement data persistence using a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
- Use design patterns such as Singleton for managing database connections and Factory for creating objects.
- Consider using frameworks like Spring for dependency injection and transaction management.

This low-level design provides a foundation for building a social network application in Java, focusing on the essential classes and their interactions.


Designing an elevator system involves creating a model that can handle multiple elevators, multiple floors, and requests from users. Below is a low-level design in Java that outlines the classes and their interactions for a simple elevator system.

### Class Diagram Overview

1. **Elevator**: Represents an elevator with its current state.
2. **ElevatorSystem**: Manages multiple elevators and handles requests.
3. **Request**: Represents a request for an elevator.

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

// Enum for Direction
enum Direction {
    UP, DOWN, NONE
}

// Class representing a request for an elevator
class Request {
    private int floor;
    private Direction direction;

    public Request(int floor, Direction direction) {
        this.floor = floor;
        this.direction = direction;
    }

    public int getFloor() {
        return floor;
    }

    public Direction getDirection() {
        return direction;
    }
}

// Class representing an elevator
class Elevator {
    private int id;
    private int currentFloor;
    private Direction direction;
    private List<Request> requests;

    public Elevator(int id) {
        this.id = id;
        this.currentFloor = 0; // Assuming ground floor is 0
        this.direction = Direction.NONE;
        this.requests = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public int getCurrentFloor() {
        return currentFloor;
    }

    public Direction getDirection() {
        return direction;
    }

    public void addRequest(Request request) {
        requests.add(request);
        // Logic to determine direction based on requests
        if (request.getFloor() > currentFloor) {
            direction = Direction.UP;
        } else if (request.getFloor() < currentFloor) {
            direction = Direction.DOWN;
        }
    }

    public void move() {
        // Move the elevator based on the direction
        if (direction == Direction.UP) {
            currentFloor++;
        } else if (direction == Direction.DOWN) {
            currentFloor--;
        }

        // Check if there are any requests to fulfill
        requests.removeIf(request -> request.getFloor() == currentFloor);
        if (requests.isEmpty()) {
            direction = Direction.NONE; // Stop if no requests
        }
    }
}

// Class representing the elevator system
class ElevatorSystem {
    private List<Elevator> elevators;

    public ElevatorSystem(int numberOfElevators) {
        elevators = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfElevators; i++) {
            elevators.add(new Elevator(i));
        }
    }

    public void requestElevator(int floor, Direction direction) {
        Request request = new Request(floor, direction);
        Elevator bestElevator = findBestElevator(request);
        bestElevator.addRequest(request);
    }

    private Elevator findBestElevator(Request request) {
        // Simple logic to find the best elevator
        // This can be improved with more complex algorithms
        Elevator bestElevator = elevators.get(0);
        for (Elevator elevator : elevators) {
            if (Math.abs(elevator.getCurrentFloor() - request.getFloor()) < 
                Math.abs(bestElevator.getCurrentFloor() - request.getFloor())) {
                bestElevator = elevator;
            }
        }
        return bestElevator;
    }

    public void step() {
        for (Elevator elevator : elevators) {
            elevator.move();
        }
    }
}

// Main class to test the elevator system
public class ElevatorSystemTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ElevatorSystem elevatorSystem = new ElevatorSystem(3); // 3 elevators

        // Simulate requests
        elevatorSystem.requestElevator(5, Direction.UP);
        elevatorSystem.requestElevator(2, Direction.DOWN);
        elevatorSystem.requestElevator(3, Direction.UP);

        // Simulate steps
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            elevatorSystem.step();
            // You can add print statements to see the state of elevators
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Request Class**: Represents a request for an elevator, including the floor number and direction.
2. **Elevator Class**: Represents an elevator with methods to add requests and move to the requested floors.
3. **ElevatorSystem Class**: Manages multiple elevators and handles incoming requests. It includes a method to find the best elevator for a request based on the current floor.
4. **Main Class**: Tests the elevator system by simulating requests and steps.

### Future Improvements

    }

    public void addTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        transactions.add(transaction);
    }

    public List<Transaction> getTransactions() {
        return transactions;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Example Usage**

Here’s how you might use these classes in a simple main method:

```java
public class DigitalWalletApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AuthenticationService authService = new AuthenticationService();
        authService.registerUser ("user@example.com", "password123");

        if (authService.loginUser ("user@example.com", "password123")) {
            User user = new User("1", "John Doe", "user@example.com", "hashedPassword");
            user.getWallet().addFunds(100.0);
            System.out.println("Current Balance: " + user.getWallet().getBalance());

            Transaction transaction = new Transaction("txn1", user.getUser Id(), 50.0, "DEPOSIT");
            user.getWallet().withdrawFunds(50.0);
            System.out.println("New Balance after withdrawal: " + user.getWallet().getBalance());

            NotificationService notificationService = new NotificationService();
            notificationService.sendNotification(user.getUser Id(), "Transaction successful: " + transaction.getTransactionId());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Login failed. Please check your credentials.");
        }
    }
}
``` 
### 4. **Additional Considerations**

#### a. **Error Handling**
Implement error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and provide feedback to users. This can include custom exceptions for invalid transactions, user not found, etc.

```java
public class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

#### b. **Logging**
Integrate a logging framework (e.g., Log4j or SLF4J) to log important events, errors, and transactions for auditing and debugging purposes.

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class TransactionService {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TransactionService.class);

    public void processTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        logger.info("Processing transaction: " + transaction.getTransactionId());
        // Transaction processing logic
    }
}
```

#### c. **Unit Testing**
Create unit tests for each class to ensure that the functionality works as expected. Use a testing framework like JUnit.

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class WalletTest {
    @Test
    public void testAddFunds() {
        Wallet wallet = new Wallet();
        wallet.addFunds(50.0);
        assertEquals(50.0, wallet.getBalance());
    }

    @Test
    public void testWithdrawFunds() {
        Wallet wallet = new Wallet();
        wallet.addFunds(50.0);
        assertTrue(wallet.withdrawFunds(20.0));
        assertEquals(30.0, wallet.getBalance());
    }
}
```

#### d. **Database Integration**
Consider integrating a database for persistent storage of user data, transactions, and wallet balances. Use an ORM framework like Hibernate or JPA for easier database interactions.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private String userId;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String passwordHash;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### e. **API Layer**
If you plan to expose the digital wallet functionalities via APIs, consider using Spring Boot to create RESTful services.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/wallet")
public class WalletController {
    @Autowired
    private WalletService walletService;

    @PostMapping("/addFunds")
    public ResponseEntity<String> addFunds(@RequestBody FundRequest request) {
        walletService.addFunds(request.getUser Id(), request.getAmount());
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Funds added successfully");
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

        // Logic to add item to the auction
    }

    public void placeBid(String itemId, String bidderId, double bidAmount) {
        // Logic to place a bid
        // Check if the bid is higher than the current bid
        // Update the current bid and create a Bid object
    }

    public void endAuction(String itemId) {
        // Logic to end the auction and notify the winner
    }

    public List<Item> getActiveItems() {
        // Logic to return a list of active auction items
    }
}
```

#### NotificationService Class

This class will handle sending notifications to users.

    public void sendSMS(String phoneNumber, String message) {
        // Logic to send an SMS notification
    }
}
```

### 4. Database Interaction

For database interactions, you can use JDBC or an ORM like Hibernate. Below is a simple example of how you might implement a method to save a user to the database.

```java
public class UserRepository {
    public void save(User user) {
        // Logic to connect to the database and save the user
        String sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password, email, phone_number, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
        // Use PreparedStatement to execute the query
    }

    public User findById(String userId) {
        // Logic to retrieve a user by ID
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

This low-level design outlines the key classes and methods necessary for implementing an online auction system in Java. Each class encapsulates specific functionality, and the interactions between them facilitate the overall operation of the system.

### Conclusion

This low-level design provides a clear structure for implementing the Concert Ticket Booking System in Java. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, promoting modularity and maintainability. The methods defined within each class outline the core functionalities required for the system, ensuring a comprehensive approach to development.


Designing a cache with an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy involves creating a data structure that can efficiently store key-value pairs and manage the order of usage. The LRU cache should support operations like `get(key)` and `put(key, value)`.

Here's a low-level design in Java using a combination of a HashMap and a doubly linked list. The HashMap will provide O(1) access to the cache items, while the doubly linked list will maintain the order of usage.

### LRU Cache Implementation

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class LRUCache {
    private class Node {
        int key;
        int value;
        Node prev;
        Node next;

        Node(int key, int value) {
            this.key = key;
            this.value = value;
        }
    }

    private final int capacity;
    private final HashMap<Integer, Node> cache;
    private Node head;
    private Node tail;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.cache = new HashMap<>();
        this.head = new Node(0, 0); // Dummy head
        this.tail = new Node(0, 0); // Dummy tail
        head.next = tail;
        tail.prev = head;
    }

    public int get(int key) {
        if (!cache.containsKey(key)) {
            return -1; // Key not found
        }
        Node node = cache.get(key);
        // Move the accessed node to the front (head)
        removeNode(node);
        addNodeToFront(node);
        return node.value;
    }

    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if (cache.containsKey(key)) {
            // Update the value and move the node to the front
            Node node = cache.get(key);
            node.value = value;
            removeNode(node);
            addNodeToFront(node);
        } else {
            if (cache.size() >= capacity) {
                // Evict the least recently used node
                Node lruNode = tail.prev;
                removeNode(lruNode);
                cache.remove(lruNode.key);
            }
            // Create a new node and add it to the front
            Node newNode = new Node(key, value);
            addNodeToFront(newNode);
            cache.put(key, newNode);
        }
    }

    private void removeNode(Node node) {
        node.prev.next = node.next;
        node.next.prev = node.prev;
    }

    private void addNodeToFront(Node node) {
        node.prev = head;
        node.next = head.next;
        head.next.prev = node;
        head.next = node;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Node Class**: Represents each entry in the cache. It contains the key, value, and pointers to the previous and next nodes in the doubly linked list.

2. **LRUCache Class**:
   - **Attributes**:
     - `capacity`: Maximum number of items the cache can hold.
     - `cache`: A HashMap that maps keys to their corresponding nodes.
     - `head` and `tail`: Dummy nodes to simplify the doubly linked list operations.
   
   - **Constructor**: Initializes the cache with a given capacity and sets up the dummy head and tail nodes.

3. **get(int key)**: 
   - If the key exists, it retrieves the node, removes it from its current position, and adds it to the front of the list (indicating it was recently used). Returns the value of the node.
   - If the key does not exist, it returns -1.

4. **put(int key, int value)**:
   - If the key already exists, it updates the value, removes the node from its current position, and adds it to the front.
   - If the key does not exist and the cache is at capacity, it removes the least recently used node (the one just before the tail) and then adds the new node to the front.

5. **removeNode(Node node)**: Removes a node from the doubly linked list.

6. **addNodeToFront(Node node)**: Adds a node right after the head, marking it as the most recently used.

### Usage Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LRUCache lruCache = new LRUCache(2);
        lruCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
        lruCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
        System.out.println(lruCache.get(1)); // returns 1
        lruCache.put(3, 3); // evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
        System.out.println(lruCache.get(2)); // returns -1 (not found)
        lruCache.put( 4, 4); // evicts key 1, cache is {3=3, 4=4}
        System.out.println(lruCache.get(1)); // returns -1 (not found)
        System.out.println(lruCache.get(3)); // returns 3
        System.out.println(lruCache.get(4)); // returns 4
    }
}

```

    private int availableSeats;

    public Showtime(String movieId, String theaterId, String startTime, String endTime, int availableSeats) {
        this.movieId = movieId;
        this.theaterId = theaterId;
        this.startTime = startTime;
        this.endTime = endTime;
        this.availableSeats = availableSeats;
    }

    public int getAvailableSeats() {
        return availableSeats;

        this.name = name;
        this.location = location;
        this.totalSeats = totalSeats;
    }

    public String getTheaterDetails() {
        return name + " located at " + location;
    }

    private String status; // e.g., confirmed, canceled

    public Booking(String userId, String showtimeId, List<String> seats, double totalPrice) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.showtimeId = showtimeId;
        this.seats = seats;
        this.totalPrice = totalPrice;
        this.status = "confirmed"; // Default status
    }

    public void createBooking() {
        // Logic to create a booking

    public Payment(String bookingId, double amount, String paymentMethod) {
        this.bookingId = bookingId;
        this.amount = amount;
        this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
    }

    public void processPayment() {
        // Logic to process payment
        paymentStatus = "successful"; // Placeholder
    }
}
```

### 3. Interaction Between Classes

- The `User ` class interacts with the `Booking` class to create and manage bookings.
- The `Movie` class retrieves showtimes from the `Showtime` class.
- The `Showtime` class interacts with the `Theater` class to get theater details and manage seat availability.
- The `Payment` class processes payments related to bookings.

### Conclusion

This low-level design provides a clear structure for implementing a Movie Ticket Booking System in Java. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, promoting modularity and maintainability. Further enhancements can include error handling, logging, and integration with external services for payment processing and user authentication.


Designing an application like Splitwise involves creating a system that allows users to track shared expenses, manage balances, and settle debts. Key components include user management, expense tracking, and algorithms for splitting costs, which can be implemented using various design patterns and architectural principles. 

**Core Features of Splitwise**

- **User  Registration and Authentication**
  - Users can create accounts and manage their profiles.
  - Secure login and password management.

- **Group Management**
  - Users can create groups and invite others to join.
  - Ability to add or remove members from groups.

- **Expense Tracking**
  - Users can add expenses with details such as amount, description, and payer.
  - Support for different split methods (equal, percentage, exact amounts).

- **Debt Calculation**
  - Automatic calculation of how much each user owes or is owed.
  - Simplification of debts to minimize transactions.

- **Settlement of Balances**
  - Users can record payments to settle debts.
  - View transaction history and group expenses.

**Object Definitions**

- **User  Object**
  ```cpp
  struct User {
      userID uid;
      string name;
      string email;
      map<userID, Balance> balances; // Balances with other users
  };
  ```

- **Group Object**
  ```cpp
  struct Group {
      GroupID gid;
      List<User> members;
      List<Expense> expenses; // Expenses associated with the group
  };
  ```

- **Expense Object**
  ```cpp
  struct Expense {
      ExpenseID eid;
      User payer; // User who paid the expense
      double amount;
      string description;
      List<Split> splits; // How the expense is split among users
  };
  ```

- **Split Class**
  - Abstract class for different splitting strategies.
  - Subclasses include:
    - **EqualSplit**: Splits the expense equally among participants.
    - **PercentSplit**: Splits the expense based on specified percentages.
    - **ExactSplit**: Allows for exact amounts to be specified for each participant.

**Implementation Considerations**

- **Concurrency Handling**
  - Use concurrent data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`) to manage simultaneous transactions.
  - Ensure data consistency during updates to user balances and expenses.

- **Service Layer**
  - A `SplitwiseService` class to manage core functionalities:
    - Adding users, groups, and expenses.
    - Calculating splits and updating balances.
    - Handling settlements and transactions.

- **User  Interface**
  - Intuitive UI for easy navigation and interaction.
  - Features for viewing balances, expenses, and transaction history.

This structured approach ensures that the Splitwise application is efficient, user-friendly, and capable of handling the complexities of shared expenses among multiple users.



Sure! Let's break down the low-level design of a Splitwise-like application in Java. We'll define classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. This design will focus on the core functionalities such as user management, group management, expense tracking, and debt calculation.

### Class Design

1. **User  Class**
   ```java
   import java.util.HashMap;
   import java.util.Map;

   public class User {
       private String userId;
       private String name;
       private String email;
       private Map<String, Double> balances; // Balances with other users

       public User(String userId, String name, String email) {
           this.userId = userId;
           this.name = name;
           this.email = email;
           this.balances = new HashMap<>();
       }

       // Getters and Setters
       public String getUser Id() { return userId; }
       public String getName() { return name; }
       public String getEmail() { return email; }
       public Map<String, Double> getBalances() { return balances; }

       public void updateBalance(String userId, double amount) {
           balances.put(userId, balances.getOrDefault(userId, 0.0) + amount);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Group Class**
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;
   import java.util.List;

   public class Group {
       private String groupId;
       private String groupName;
       private List<User> members;
       private List<Expense> expenses;

       public Group(String groupId, String groupName) {
           this.groupId = groupId;
           this.groupName = groupName;
           this.members = new ArrayList<>();
           this.expenses = new ArrayList<>();
       }

       public void addMember(User user) {
           members.add(user);
       }

       public void addExpense(Expense expense) {
           expenses.add(expense);
           // Update balances for each member based on the expense
           expense.calculateSplits(members);
       }

       // Getters
       public List<User> getMembers() { return members; }
       public List<Expense> getExpenses() { return expenses; }
   }
   ```

3. **Expense Class**
   ```java
   import java.util.HashMap;
   import java.util.List;
   import java.util.Map;

   public class Expense {
       private String expenseId;
       private User payer;
       private double amount;
       private String description;
       private Map<String, Double> splits; // UserId -> Amount

       public Expense(String expenseId, User payer, double amount, String description) {
           this.expenseId = expenseId;
           this.payer = payer;
           this.amount = amount;
           this.description = description;
           this.splits = new HashMap<>();
       }

       public void addSplit(String userId, double amount) {
           splits.put(userId, amount);
       }

       public void calculateSplits(List<User> members) {
           double splitAmount = amount / members.size();
           for (User  member : members) {
               if (!member.getUser Id().equals(payer.getUser Id())) {
                   addSplit(member.getUser Id(), splitAmount);
                   member.updateBalance(payer.getUser Id(), splitAmount); // Member owes payer
                   payer.updateBalance(member.getUser Id(), -splitAmount); // Payer is owed
               }
           }
       }

       // Getters
       public String getExpenseId() { return expenseId; }
       public User getPayer() { return payer; }
       public double getAmount() { return amount; }
       public String getDescription() { return description; }
       public Map<String, Double> getSplits() { return splits; }
   }
   ```

4. **Split Class (Abstract)**
   ```java
   public abstract class Split {
       protected double amount;

       public abstract void calculateSplit(List<User> members);
   }

   public class EqualSplit extends Split {
       public EqualSplit(double amount) {
           this.amount = amount;
       }

       @Override
       public void calculateSplit(List<User> members) {
           double splitAmount = amount / members.size();
           for (User  member : members) {
               // Logic to update balances
           }
       }
   }

   // Additional split types can be implemented similarly
   ```

5. **SplitwiseService Class**
   ```java
   import java.util.HashMap;
   import java.util.Map;

   public class SplitwiseService {
       private Map<String, User> users;
       private Map<String, Group> groups;

       public SplitwiseService() {
           users = new HashMap<>();
           groups = new HashMap<>();
       }

       public void addUser (String userId, String name, String email) {
           users.put(userId, new User(userId, name, email));
       }

       public void createGroup(String groupId, String groupName) {
           groups.put(groupId , new Group(groupId, groupName));
       }

       public void addMemberToGroup(String groupId, String userId) {
           Group group = groups.get(groupId);
           User user = users.get(userId);
           if (group != null && user != null) {
               group.addMember(user);
           }
       }

       public void addExpense(String groupId, String expenseId, String payerId, double amount, String description) {
           Group group = groups.get(groupId);
           User payer = users.get(payerId);
           if (group != null && payer != null) {
               Expense expense = new Expense(expenseId, payer, amount, description);
               group.addExpense(expense);

Designing a Snake and Ladder game involves creating the game board, defining the rules, and outlining the gameplay mechanics. Below is a comprehensive design for a classic Snake and Ladder game.

### Game Components

1. **Game Board**:
   - A square grid of 10x10 squares (100 squares total).
   - Each square is numbered from 1 to 100.
   - Snakes and ladders are placed on specific squares:
     - **Ladders**: Allow players to move up to a higher square.
     - **Snakes**: Cause players to slide down to a lower square.

2. **Game Pieces**:
   - Each player has a distinct game piece (e.g., a token, a small figurine).
   - Players can choose their colors or designs.

3. **Dice**:
   - A standard six-sided die (1-6).

4. **Players**:
   - The game can be played by 2 to 4 players.

### Game Setup

1. **Board Layout**:
   - Draw a 10x10 grid and number the squares from 1 to 100.
   - Place ladders and snakes on the board:
     - Example Ladders:
       - Square 3 to 22
       - Square 5 to 8
       - Square 11 to 26
       - Square 20 to 29
     - Example Snakes:
       - Square 17 to 4
       - Square 19 to 7
       - Square 21 to 9
       - Square 27 to 1

2. **Starting Position**:
   - All players start at square 1.

### Game Rules

1. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to be the first player to reach square 100.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling the die.
   - The player moves their piece forward the number of squares rolled.
   - If a player lands on the bottom of a ladder, they climb up to the top of the ladder.
   - If a player lands on the head of a snake, they slide down to the tail of the snake.
   - If a player rolls a 6, they get an extra turn.
   - If a player rolls a number that would take them past square 100, they do not move and must wait for their next turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to land exactly on square 100 wins the game.
   - If a player rolls a number that would take them past 100, they must stay in their current position until their next turn.

### Optional Variations

1. **Multiple Dice**: Use two dice for faster gameplay.
2. **Power-ups**: Introduce cards that players can draw for special abilities (e.g., skip a snake, move forward extra spaces).
3. **Time Limit**: Set a time limit for each turn to keep the game moving quickly.

### Implementation

The game can be implemented physically with a printed board and tokens or digitally as a computer or mobile game. For a digital version, consider using a programming language like Python, JavaScript, or a game development platform like Unity.

### Conclusion

This design provides a comprehensive overview of how to create a Snake and Ladder game. You can customize the board layout, the number of players, and the rules to suit your preferences. Enjoy playing!

        // Logic to process payment
        return true; // Placeholder for successful payment
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

#### b. Review Class
A class to manage product reviews could also be implemented.

```java
public class Review {
    private String reviewId;
    private String productId;
    private String userId;
    private String comment;
    private int rating;

    public Review(String reviewId, String productId, String userId, String comment, int rating) {
        this.reviewId = reviewId;
        this.productId = productId;
        this.userId = userId;
        this.comment = comment;
        this.rating = rating;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

Designing a chess game involves several components, including the game rules, board layout, pieces, and user interface (if it's a digital game). Below is a comprehensive outline for designing a chess game:

### 1. Game Overview
- **Objective**: Checkmate the opponent's king.
- **Players**: Two players, one controlling white pieces and the other controlling black pieces.

### 2. Game Components

#### A. Chessboard
- **Layout**: An 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares.
- **Coordinates**: Each square can be identified by a combination of letters (a-h) and numbers (1-8).
- **Initial Setup**:
  - **Row 1 (White)**: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook
  - **Row 2 (White)**: 8 Pawns
  - **Row 7 (Black)**: 8 Pawns
  - **Row 8 (Black)**: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook

#### B. Chess Pieces
- **Types of Pieces**:
  - **King**: Moves one square in any direction.
  - **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
  - **Rook**: Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.
  - **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
  - **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular).
  - **Pawn**: Moves forward one square (two squares on its first move) and captures diagonally.

#### C. Special Moves
- **Castling**: A move involving the king and a rook.
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture.
- **Promotion**: A pawn reaching the opposite end of the board can be promoted to any piece (except a king).

### 3. Game Rules
- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with White.
- **Winning the Game**: A player wins by checkmating the opponent's king.
- **Draw Conditions**: Stalemate, insufficient material, threefold repetition, or the fifty-move rule.

### 4. User Interface (for Digital Version)
- **Board Display**: A graphical representation of the chessboard with pieces.
- **Piece Movement**: Drag-and-drop functionality or click-to-move.
- **Game Status**: Display current player, check/checkmate status, and move history.
- **Settings**: Options for time controls (e.g., blitz, classical), piece styles, and board themes.

### 5. Game Logic (for Digital Version)
- **Move Validation**: Ensure moves comply with chess rules.
- **AI Opponent**: Implement algorithms for single-player mode (e.g., Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning).
- **Undo/Redo Moves**: Allow players to revert to previous states.

### 6. Additional Features
- **Tutorial Mode**: Teach new players the rules and strategies.
- **Multiplayer Options**: Online play, local play, or against AI.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Record wins, losses, and draws for players.
- **Hints and Analysis**: Provide suggestions for moves and analyze past games.

### 7. Development Considerations
- **Platform**: Decide whether the game will be web-based, mobile, or desktop.
- **Technology Stack**: Choose programming languages and frameworks (e.g., JavaScript for web, Unity for mobile).
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing for bugs and gameplay balance.

### 8. Launch and Marketing
- **Beta Testing**: Release a beta version to gather feedback.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Use social media, chess communities, and gaming platforms to promote the game.

By following this outline, you can create a comprehensive chess game that is engaging and enjoyable for players of all skill levels.

### 2. Class Definitions

#### User Class
```java
public abstract class User {
    protected int userId;
    protected String name;
    protected String email;
    protected String role;

    public User(int userId, String name, String email, String role) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        this.role = role;
    }

    public abstract void login();
    public abstract void logout();
}
```

#### Student Class
```java
import java.util.List;

public class Student extends User {
    private List<Enrollment> enrollments;

    public Student(int userId, String name, String email) {
        super(userId, name, email, "Student");
        this.enrollments = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void registerCourse(Course course) {
        // Logic to register for a course
    }

    public void deregisterCourse(Course course) {
        // Logic to deregister from a course
    }

    public List<Grade> viewGrades() {
        // Logic to view grades
        return null; // Placeholder
    }
}
```

#### Instructor Class
```java
import java.util.List;

public class Instructor extends User {
    private List<Course> courses;

    public Instructor(int userId, String name, String email) {
        super(userId, name, email, "Instructor");
        this.courses = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void gradeStudent(Enrollment enrollment, String grade) {
        // Logic to grade a student
    }

    public List<Course> getCourses() {
        return courses;
    }
}
```

#### Course Class
```java
import java.util.List;

public class Course {
    private int courseId;
    private String courseName;
    private int credits;
    private int instructorId;
    private List<Enrollment> enrollments;

    public Course(int courseId, String courseName, int credits, int instructorId) {
        this.courseId = courseId;
        this.courseName = courseName;
        this.credits = credits;
        this.instructorId = instructorId;
        this.enrollments = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addCourse() {
        // Logic to add course
    }

    public void removeCourse() {
        // Logic to remove course
    }

    public String getDetails() {
        return courseName + " (" + credits + " credits)";
    }
}
```

#### Enrollment Class
```java
public class Enrollment {
    private int enrollmentId;
    private int userId;
    private int courseId;
    private String semester;

    public Enrollment(int enrollmentId, int userId, int courseId, String semester) {
        this.enrollmentId = enrollmentId;
        this.userId = userId;
        this.courseId = courseId;
        this.semester = semester;
    }

    public void enroll() {
        // Logic to enroll a student in a course
    }

    public void drop() {
        // Logic to drop a course
    }

    public String getGrade() {
        // Logic to retrieve the grade for this enrollment
        return ""; // Placeholder
    }
}
```

### 3. Additional Classes

#### Grade Class
```java
public class Grade {
    private int gradeId;
    private int enrollmentId;
    private String grade;

    public Grade(int gradeId, int enrollmentId, String grade) {
        this.gradeId = gradeId;
        this.enrollmentId = enrollmentId;
        this.grade = grade;
    }

    public String getGrade() {
        return grade;
    }
}
```

### 4. Main Application Class
```java
import java.util.List;

public class CourseRegistrationSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize users, courses, and enrollments
        // Example usage of the system
        Student student = new Student(1, "John Doe", "john@example.com");
        Instructor instructor = new Instructor(2, "Dr. Smith", "smith@example.com");
        Course course = new Course(101, "Introduction to Programming", 3, instructor.getUser Id());

        // Register student for a course
        student.registerCourse(course);
        // View grades
        List<Grade> grades = student.viewGrades();
    }
}
```

This low-level design provides a clear structure for implementing the University Course Registration System in Java, detailing the classes, their relationships, and the methods necessary for functionality.
